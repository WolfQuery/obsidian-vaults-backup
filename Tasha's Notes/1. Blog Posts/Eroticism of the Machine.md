# Eroticism of the Machine

To start off this essay, it is important to separate erotism and sex-appeal. While they are inherently tied to each other, they are not the same. Erotism is defied by the the Merriam-Webster dictionary as follows: 
> [!quote] Eroticism
> 1. an [erotic](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/erotic) theme or quality
> 2.  a state of sexual arousa
> 3. insistent sexual impulse or desire
