# Welcome :3c

Haiii, I'm **Natasha** but u can just call me **Tasha** ([She/Them](https://en.pronouns.page/@moonwolf21)). I also go by *WolfQuery*, *Oromis Foxtail* or *VHS* in some places. I mostly code and make art, sometimes I try something new and once in a while I cosplay as well.

## Hobbies

### Coding
I code in [Python](https://www.python.org/) and [GDScript](https://gdscript.com/). I mostly make tools and CLIs for myself, but once in a while I also do game development in the [Godot Engine](https://godotengine.org/)

#### Current Projects:
```dataview
table without id link(file.name, name) as Name, progress as Progress, date_start as "Start Date"
from "Projects" 
where active = true and WIP = true
```

 ### Photography
 I have two cameras, a gorgeous old **Nikon D40**

And a more travel compact **Lumix DMC-LX15** for when I just need quick snaps

You can see some of the pictures I've taken in the [[Picture Gallery]]

### Cosplay
I do cosplay!
*I'll eventually post something here*

---
### Art
I make art, nowadays more digital than physical but once in a while I like to return to the roots.
My focus is mostly on [**Surrealism**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surrealism), [**Unreality**](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/unreality), [**Dream-core**](https://aesthetics.fandom.com/wiki/Dreamcore) and [**Impressionism**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impressionism)

You can checkout most of my pieces in the [[Art Gallery|Art Gallery]].

### Music
I make music once in a while... Might post some here

---
### Blog
I write some essays and thoughts once in a while, you'll see them here <3
```dataview
table without id link(file.name, title) as "Title", date as "Published"
from "Blog Posts"
where contains(tags, "blog") and date and dg-publish = true
sort date desc
limit 5
```

> [!example]- All blog posts
>```dataview
>table without id link(file.name, title) as "Title", date as "Published"
>from "Blog Posts"
>where contains(tags, "blog") and date and dg-publish = true
