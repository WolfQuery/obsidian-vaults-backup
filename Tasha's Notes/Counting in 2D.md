# 🌌 2D Counting, Complex Numbers, and Collapsing to 1D — Detailed Notes

---

## 1. Introduction

> [!note]  
> These notes explore counting in 2D using complex numbers, representing numbers graphically, projecting them into 1D, and understanding the geometric meaning of operations like addition, multiplication, and collapse. The goal is to use **visual reasoning** to understand arithmetic, algebra, and equation solving.

---

## 2. Complex Numbers as 2D Counting

- Numbers can be represented as points in 2D:
    

$$  
z = x + yi  
$$

Where:

- $x$ = real part → movement along the **x-axis**
    
- $y$ = imaginary part → movement along the **y-axis**
    
- **Graphical counting rules:**
    

|Number|Direction|Step size|
|---|---|---|
|$+1$|x-axis|+1 horizontally|
|$-1$|x-axis|-1 horizontally|
|$+i$|y-axis|+1 vertically|
|$-i$|y-axis|-1 vertically|

> [!callout]  
> $1$ is the base unit of the x-axis; $i$ is the base unit of the y-axis. They are _metaphorical equivalents_ as units but function on perpendicular axes.

### 2.1 Properties of (i)

- Defined by:
    

$$  
i^2 = -1  
$$

- Geometric meaning:
    

$$  
1 \xrightarrow{\times i} i \xrightarrow{\times i} -1 \xrightarrow{\times i} -i \xrightarrow{\times i} 1  
$$

> [!callout]  
> Multiplying by $i$ corresponds to a **90° rotation** counterclockwise in the 2D plane.

- You can think of it as a **unit vector along the y-axis**:
    

$$  
1 = (1, 0), \quad i = (0, 1)  
$$

- Squaring $i$ flips direction along the real axis:
    

$$  
i^2 = -1  
$$

---

### 2.2 Other “imaginary numbers”

- All imaginary numbers in 2D are rotations of $i$:
    

|Symbol|Meaning|
|---|---|
|$i$|90° rotation|
|$\omega = e^{i2\pi/3}$|120° rotation (cube root of unity)|
|$\zeta_n = e^{i2\pi/n}$|nth root of unity, n evenly spaced directions|

> [!callout]  
> In 2D, imaginary numbers are **essentially rotations along the plane**, representing perpendicular or angled movement.

---

## 3. Collapsing 2D Counting into 1D

- **Magnitude** of a complex number:
    

$$  
|z| = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2}  
$$

- Collapsing replaces the 2D vector with its **1D real-length equivalent**, eliminating the explicit need to manipulate $(i = \sqrt{-1})$ symbolically.
    

> [!callout]  
> Collapsing is useful for arithmetic simplification, visual reasoning, and computing magnitudes without handling $i$ directly.

---

### 3.1 Drawback of collapse

- The collapse loses **directional information** (sign/phase):
    

$$  
K = \pm |z|  
$$

- The result is **magnitude only**, so multiple points in 2D can collapse to the same 1D value.
    

---

### 3.2 Geometric interpretation

- Most 2D results are **lines** (linear equations) or **circles** (quadratic forms).
    
- Projection rules:
    

|2D Shape|1D Projection|Interpretation|
|---|---|---|
|Line|Point on x-axis|Unique solution|
|Circle|Range $[-r, r]$|Multiple solutions (±)|
|No intersection|∅|No solution in $\mathbb{R}$|

- Example:
    

$$  
z = 3 + 4i \implies |z| = \sqrt{3^2 + 4^2} = 5  
$$

- Circle of radius 5 → projection onto x-axis:
    

$$  
x \in [-5, 5]  
$$

---

### 3.3 Pythagoras as the collapse law

> [!callout]  
> Collapsing from 2D to 1D is equivalent to applying **Pythagoras’ theorem**:

$$  
|z| = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2}  
$$

- Geometry encodes what $\sqrt{-1}$ encodes algebraically.
    
- Collapse gives absolute value; the sign or phase must be tracked separately.

## 4. Preserving Exact Location

To retain the **full 2D information** while still performing simplified arithmetic:

1. **Vector representation**:
    

$$  
(x, y)  
$$

2. **Polar coordinates**:
    

$$  
x = r \cos \theta, \quad y = r \sin \theta  
$$

- $r = |z|$ → magnitude
    
- $\theta = \tan^{-1}(y/x)$ → direction
    

3. **Dimensional label notation**:
    

$$  
z = x_1 + y_1 i  
$$

- Collapse to 1D only for computation, keep $y$ or $\theta$ to reconstruct the full point.
    

> [!callout]  
> To solve 2-variable equations exactly (e.g., $5x - 3y + 7 = 25$), you must **retain 2D coordinates or polar form**; collapsing to magnitude alone gives only ranges.

---

## 5. Solving Equations Geometrically

- Represent solution sets as **lines or curves in 2D**.
    
- Collapse to 1D for **ranges or magnitude reasoning**:
    

### 5.1 Example: Linear equation

$$  
5x - 3y + 7 = 25 \implies 5x - 3y = 18  
$$

- Parametric solution:
    

$$  
y = \frac{5x - 18}{3} \quad \text{or as vector: } (x, \frac{5x-18}{3})  
$$

- Graphically: line in 2D.
    
- Collapse: single x-coordinate if it intersects the x-axis; otherwise, multiple x-values form a **range**.
    

### 5.2 Example: Quadratic (circle)

$$  
x^2 + y^2 = r^2  
$$

- 2D solution: circle of radius $r$
    
- Collapse onto x-axis:
    

$$  
x \in [-r, r]  
$$

> [!callout]  
> Circle → projected range; Line → single point; No intercept → no real solution.

| Magnitude only |                 | $z$                     | $= \sqrt{x^2 + y^2}$                                           |
| 1D projection  | Range on x-axis | Interval / point / none | Magnitude only; geometrically represents all possible x-values |

>     
> - Absolute value $\pm$ appears naturally when projecting to 1D.
>

>     
> - Visual intuition allows prediction of solutions without full algebraic manipulation.

## 8. Advantages of Visual/2D Approach

1. **See equations as shapes** — intersections, ranges, solutions.
    
2. **Use geometry instead of symbolic $i$** — reduces algebraic complexity.
    
3. **Predict solution existence and multiplicity** visually.
    
4. **Extendable to higher dimensions** — understanding 2D projections is the foundation for 3D, 4D, and even quaternion reasoning.
    
5. **Magnitude-first reasoning** — collapse after compacting $x$ and $y$ avoids manipulating $\sqrt{-1}$ directly.

## 9. Practical Notes

- **Collapse after arithmetic**: combine x and y components first, then collapse using Pythagoras.
    
- **Keep direction**: if exact solutions are needed, track $\theta$ or keep $(x, y)$.
    
- **Equation solvability in $\mathbb{R}$**: check if projected line/circle intersects the real axis.
    
- **Use callouts** for key concepts like the magnitude law, absolute value ±, and geometric interpretation.
