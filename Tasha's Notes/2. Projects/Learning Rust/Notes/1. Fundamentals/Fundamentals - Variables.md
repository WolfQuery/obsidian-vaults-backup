# Variables
> [!summary] 
> - Variables assign data to a temporary memory location
> 	- Allows programmers to easily work with memory
> - Can be set to **any** value & type
> - Immutable by default, but can be mutable
> 	- *Immutable*: cannot be changed
> 	- *Mutable:* can be changed

## Examples:
```rust
let two = 2;
let hello = "hello";
let j = 'j';
let my_half = 0.5;
let mut my_name = "Bill";
let quit_program = false;
let your_half = my_half;
```
> [!tip] Recap
> - Variables make it easier to work with data
> - Variables can be assigned to any value
> 	- This includes **other variables**
> - Immutable by default
