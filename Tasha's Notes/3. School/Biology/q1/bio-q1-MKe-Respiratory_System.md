# Respiratory System

> [!question]- Why is there life on Earth?
> 1. Proper Distance to the Sun
> 2. Magnetic Core
> 3. Atmosphere
> 4. Water
> 5. Oxygen

> [!question]- Why do we breathe?
> To transport oxygen through blood into our muscles to burn fuel for energy/movement


## Respiration
- All of this energy comes from the food that we eat.
- The food is digested
	- i. e. broken down into smaller molecules - which are <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">absorbed from the intestine into the blood</mark>.
- The <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">blood transports the nutrients</mark> to all the cells in the body
- The cells take up the nutrients that they need.
- The main nutrient used to provide energy in cells is glucose.
	- It contains a lot of chemical energy
- In order to make use of this energy, cells have to <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">breakdown the glucose molecules and release the energy from them</mark>.

> [!note]
> *They do this in a series of metabolic reactions called **respiration**.*
### Chemical side of Respiration
$$
\displaylines{
\text{Water} = \ce{H2O} \\
\text{Glucose} = \ce{C6H12O6}\\
\ce{C6H12O6 + 6O2 -> 6CO2 + 6H20 + \text{ATP} \textit{(Energy)}}}
