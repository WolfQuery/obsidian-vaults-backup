# Introduction 

A template in obsidian is a file that can be reused to either create or insert fixed or dynamic information into a file. 
For example let's say you want to add the following  paragraph of text into a file you would use a template to be able to dynamically add the file name and the current date. 

"This file named *{Insert file name here}* has been modified by me on the *{insert current date here}* "

We use the "Templater" community plugin to improve on the core "Templates" plugin in obsidian, as the templater plugin offers much more possibility on how to create templates.
