# Introduction 

An global resource is a resource that do not fit either in a documented activity or in a documented competence. 
For example, a quote on the beauty of nature could potentially be a resource for a project you might have to write a book about dancing in the woods, but for most people it's just an interesting quote. 
A global resource should be easily retrieved in the resources folder. For that we advise a "shallow" folder structure organized by "objects". Meaning that in your resources : quotes go with quotes,  pay slips go with pay slips, books go with books. 
Obviously the folder structure is yours, any way to organize it is okay as long as it helps your retrieve a file when needed.  ^0igw2m
