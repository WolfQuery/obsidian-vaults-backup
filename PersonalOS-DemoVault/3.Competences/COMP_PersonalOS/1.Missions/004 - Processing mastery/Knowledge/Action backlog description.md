# Introduction

The action backlogs simply list available actions in files that are "Handled By" the current file. It usually goes well with the file backlog and allow for batching quick actions in the context of a centralized list. 
The action backlog goes particularly well with recurring actions that you want to do in quick succession in one "batch" session. 
The "Batch system processing" and "Batch Trigger review" routines both use an action backlog.
