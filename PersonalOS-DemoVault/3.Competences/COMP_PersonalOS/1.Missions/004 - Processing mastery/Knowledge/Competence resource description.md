# Introduction 

A competence resource is a resource that is useful in the context of that competence. It could theoretically be used for any activity applying this competence.
For example a guide on how to organize a project kick-off meeting could be used in any project. 
Another example would be a template for a technical documentation that could be use in any project requiring you to produce such documentation. 
A competence resource needs to be easily retrieved while consulting that competence. ^z6q819
