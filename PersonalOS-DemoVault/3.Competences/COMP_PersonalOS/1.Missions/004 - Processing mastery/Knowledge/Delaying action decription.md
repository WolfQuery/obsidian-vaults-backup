# Introduction

When processing a file or when reviewing a file, the most common thing to do is to "delay" actions in that file to an ulterior date. 
In the GTD method, it is advised to either put that action on a calendar if you are sure about the date, or just flag it as a "Someday Maybe" action. 
This often lead to extremely bloated "Someday maybe" lists that are seldom reviewed. 
In Personal OS, we advise delaying the task randomly in an time interval.  ^4azfhx
