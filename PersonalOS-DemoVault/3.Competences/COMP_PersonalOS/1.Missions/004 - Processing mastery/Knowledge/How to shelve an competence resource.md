## Process to shelve a competence resource

- Define what that resource is by adding a tag in the "tags" property
- Link the supported competence or skill in the "Supports" property
- Finish processing that resource depending if it's actionable or not
- If actionable you should make sure that resource is "Handled By" an activity since moving it to the competence folder will prevent it from showing automatically in the "Engage" feature
- Move that resource to the same folder as your competence
