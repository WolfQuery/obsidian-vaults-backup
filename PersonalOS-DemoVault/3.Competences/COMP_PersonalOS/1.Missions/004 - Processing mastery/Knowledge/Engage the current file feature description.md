# Introduction

"Engage current file" is an intelligent script with the objective to automatically bring to your attention the file in your system **in the context of your current backlog** that requires it the most. It uses almost the same algorithm as the "Engage" feature, with 2 major  exceptions : 
- It also brings back "late" files. 
-  It is not constrained to "Work in progress" folder (**allowing for backlog actions on archived or resources files**)

# How the script works
