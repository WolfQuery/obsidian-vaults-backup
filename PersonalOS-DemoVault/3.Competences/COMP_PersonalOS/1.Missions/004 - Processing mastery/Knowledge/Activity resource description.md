# Introduction 

An activity resource is a resource that can only be used in the context of that activity. For example a meeting note only make sense in your "Work" responsibility, or in a specific project in which you participate. 
Another example would be a reflection you have on a personal project, that reflection only make sense in the context of that project. 
An activity resource needs to be easily retrieved in the context on that activity. ^idk5gt
