## Ways to delay actions

Generate an random date in an interval : 
- Use the hotkey **"Alt + D" (Alternative Delay)**
- Use the command palette (CTRL+P) and search for "Generate Random Delay"

Delay already existing dates on a file actions : 
- Use the hotkey **"Alt + shift +  D" (Alternative Super Delay)**
- Use the command palette (CTRL+P) and search for "Actions Random Delay"


## Tips and tricks
 If you want to delay an action for more than a year, you can add a manual date but also consider that this action might not be relevant, if it's really important, it will come back to you, and sometimes deleting or archiving the file is the right approach !  ^cn8slc
