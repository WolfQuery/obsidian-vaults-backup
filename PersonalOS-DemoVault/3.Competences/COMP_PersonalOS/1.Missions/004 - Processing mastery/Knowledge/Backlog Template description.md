# [[Backlog Template]]

The backlog template is a tool that can be use in any kind of file when needed. It simply insert all existing types of backlogs  ( [[Action backlog examples|action backlog]] and [[File backlog example|file backlog]] ). Use that template for any file where you want to "aggregate" a list of tasks or subject to facilitate the use of the engage feature. ^iznx4s
