# What is a context ? 

A context is another file without which the current file should not exist. 
For example, a sub-project exists in the context of a project. Without the "parent" project, the sub-project should not even exists. 


# Why use contexts ? 

Contexts are by no means required, and they can sometimes feel like they are providing the same utility as folders. 
But they are extremely powerful to manage activities and we strongly encourage to use them. While a folder tree can provide you with a structure to even organize non obsidian files, the context tree allow for the construction of very flexible views on your system. 

Just visualize it, using context in Personal OS I'm able to : 

- Show a tree of all projects, subprojects and tasks, created to attain a goal. 
- Calculate how many actions are done each week for a given project (even if those actions are done in subprojects).
- Show a pie chart graph of how many XP points I obtained last week for the different goals I have. 

Here is an example of a project activity tree :
