# Introduction 

A project is a complex kind of activity, apart from mediating actions, it usually entails phases, sub-projects, related tasks, resources. All toward a defined project goal. One of the defining aspect of a project is that it is finite. A project needs to have an "end" to be a project. A project without an end is a responsibility.  ^xc8mg5
