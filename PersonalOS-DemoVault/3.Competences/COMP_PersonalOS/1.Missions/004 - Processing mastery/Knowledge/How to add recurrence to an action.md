## Adding a recurrence to an action 

- Use the "tasks plugin" autocompletion by typing the start of the word "recurring" to add the "üîÅ " symbol, note that a recurrence needs to be added BEFORE any date, but AFTER  a time if you add a time to the action. 
- Add a recurrence after that symbol for examples : 
	- every day
	- every 4 days
	- every weekday
	- every week on Monday, Tuesday
	- Every 2 weeks on Wednesday
	- Every month on the 1st
	- Every month on the 2nd last Friday
	- Every 6 month
	- You can try your examples in the "Text input" section of this demo : [rrule.js demo](https://jkbrzt.github.io/rrule/)
