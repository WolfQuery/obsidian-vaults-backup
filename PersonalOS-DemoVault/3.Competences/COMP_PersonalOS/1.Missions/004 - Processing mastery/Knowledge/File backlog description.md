# Introduction

Let me paint you a picture, at some point if you completely trust your system, it will contain an extremely large number of actionable files.  Some of those files are complicated to schedule or delay because giving them attention depends on a larger activity being started or worked on. 

Here is an example, let's say you have a project to write a blog, but that project is not started yet. You have a dedicated file for that project that is delayed for next month. 
Obviously at some points you will have some ideas about that future project and capture new files for those ideas. Depending on the project this list of new files can be very large.  See the following illustration , each list item represent a separate file : 

- Write a blog on exotic cuisine 
	- Check this existing Indian blog for interesting recipes
	- Check this existing African blog for interesting recipes
	- Choose a tool to write the blog
	- Buy a Domain name
	- Reflections on how to drive traffic
	- Reflection on how to adapts articles based on the season
	- Other cuisine blogger community
	- Idea of making articles based on chefs interviews
	- Making sure the blog is readable on mobile
	- Find a way to get reader e-mail address to send a news-letter
	- Choose a tool to send a news-latter


You get the idea ... now imagine that each one of those files contains an action with a start date and is delayed, each time any of those file would show-up in the "Engage" feature, you would just delay it again since the overarching project has not been started yet. If you delay the project, you probably want to also delay all those files. 
And even if the project is already started, you might only want  the project file itself to show-up automatically, then choose or ask the system to choose for you a new file to focus on "in the context" of that project. 

The concept of backlog brings a solution to all those issues.

**By declaring that a file is "Handled By" another file, the handled file is now considered part of that other file backlog and will not show-up automatically in the "Engage" feature, but you can still automatically access it using the "Engage current file" command (ALT + 3, alternative third workflow) while in the overarching backlog file, you can also see a list of "Handled" files in the backlog file by using the file backlog widget.**
