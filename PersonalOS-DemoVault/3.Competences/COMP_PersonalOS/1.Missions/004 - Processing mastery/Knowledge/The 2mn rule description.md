# Introduction 

The 2mn rule is introduced in the GTD method as a central rule for processing. It's application is very easy and the reasoning behind it is also easy to understand. 

**When processing a file, if the next action that the file requires can be done in 2mn or less, do it directly then either think of another action or delete the file instead of processing it.** 

The idea is that the simple act of processing and scheduling a file, then coming back to it to actually do the action costs MORE than just doing it directly. So why bother postponing it ?
