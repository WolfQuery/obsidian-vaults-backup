> [!success] In practice
> ### If you have done a mind sweep and reserved files for processing 
> - Check the "2.Activity" folder and look for already created projects folders or files
> - Look for 3 to 4 candidate files from your mind sweep that can represent a resource for one of those projects
> - Process them and add the "Context" property, referencing their relevant project 
> - Check in the project file how those newly created files are appearing in the Activity tree and in the context tree
> ### Else
> - Choose one of you project file in which you used the project template
> - Create a new file and add the tag "Reflection" in the "tags" property
> - Since that reflection only make sense in the context of that project, add a link to that project in the "Context" property
> - Reflect for 1mn about your project 
> - Add a next action to that reflection and either delay it or handle it to your project using the "Handled By" property
> - Move that reflection to your project folder
> - Verify your project file and confirm that your reflection is shown in the Full context tree
