## Introduction 

Mind sweeping is close to being the most important and difficult challenge when moving from an instinctual to a systemic method of organization. The idea is simple, to fully trust your system, it needs to be complete and up to date. For that to happen you need to feed it with everything that is currently clogging your mind. The mind sweep is the tactic for that. 
By reviewing a large list of triggers, you can make the necessary link to all those ideas renting a space in your mind and can insure a complete collection of those subjects that eat at your attention. 
The goal is volume !! Think of it as a kind of brainstorming, do not judge the content, do not try to process while doing a mind sweep, do not even try to judge of the importance or priority of any subject.  
Every idea crossing your mind should have a dedicated file. The average knowledge worker can create between 100 and 250 files during this exercise and will feel a weird sense of clarity when finished.  ^p9v0bs
