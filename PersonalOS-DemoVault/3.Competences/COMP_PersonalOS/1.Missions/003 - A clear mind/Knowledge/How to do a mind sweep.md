## Mind sweeping workflow

- Open the "Collecting" workspace
- Read the triggers one by one 
- For each trigger, if something comes to your mind
	- Create a new file and write a short title, only enough for you to know what the file represents
	- Keep creating unique files for every ideas that come to mind
