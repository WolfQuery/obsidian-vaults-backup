# What is a tactic in Personal OS ? 

We define a tactic as a template for executing a Skill.
To understand that concept it's useful to review the concepts of competences and skills. 

**Competence** is defined in the first course as  "*a combination of skills, knowledge, and attitudes that are necessary to effectively perform tasks and solve problems*"

**Skill** is defined as "*a combination of knowledge, and attitudes that are necessary to effectively perform a dedicated set of tasks*"

The difference in those definition is a fine line, but basically a skill can be "directly applicable" while a competence is only applicable through dedicated skills. A competence can be split into many skills, while skills are sufficient by themselves. 

In that context, a "tactic" is simply an obsidian template (think checklist) to apply a specific skill. 
A skill does not necessary need a tactic, but they are a powerful tool to encourage consistence and easy skill building.
