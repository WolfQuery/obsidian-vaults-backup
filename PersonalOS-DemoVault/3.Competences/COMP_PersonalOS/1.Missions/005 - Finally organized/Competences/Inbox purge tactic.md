> [!tip] 
> The processing workspace contains a recap of the processing flowcharts and a recap of useful hotkeys in the right panel sidebar. Use them to your advantage !

> [!success] In practice

> - Treat this as a cinema session, put your phone in silence mode, close your door, turn-off the tv, put some music you like working to
> - Make sure everything that needs to be processed is in your Inbox.
> - Open the "Processing" workspace and proceed to purge your Inbox (CTRL+P and search "Load: Processing)
