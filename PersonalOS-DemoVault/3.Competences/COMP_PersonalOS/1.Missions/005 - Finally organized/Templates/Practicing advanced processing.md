> [!warning] Important
> Before generating files for this training, **create a subfolder "Process" in the 2.Activities folder**. This folder will receive some generated files and all your processed files. Allowing you to delete it after this exercise to keep your system clean. 
> Also, **make sure the 1.Inbox folder is empty**, if needed create a temporary folder and move all your inbox files into it first. 

> [!success] In practice
> Once you've created the "Process" folder and cleaned up your system : 
> - Generate the training files using the button bellow. 
> - Open the "Processing" workspace by using the command palette (CTRL+P) and searching for "Load: Processing" 
> - Use the "Process" feature (ALT +2) until you're finished with processing everything. Then continue using the "Engage" feature
