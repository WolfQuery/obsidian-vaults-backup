# The batch processing routine
Once a day, some time is dedicated to keep your operating system clean and up to date. This does not only apply to your Personal OS main Inbox but to your entire system.
Think of it like checking your e-mails, your inboxes needs to be regularly emptied for you to avoid stressing about potential responsibilities that your might not be honoring. 
By using an action backlog, this routine offers the flexibility of having different recurrence applied to different Inboxes. By default only one "handled by" routine is provided to empty your main Persona OS inbox. But you might want to add other recurring actions, for example : 
- Your professional e-mail could be emptied once every weekday
- Your personal Inbox could be emptied 2 times a week
- Your professional computer desktop or download folder could be emptied once every 2 weeks. 

Note that by default, the batch processing routine uses automatic workspace opening to open the "Processing" workspace.
