## Random events in Personal OS

In the Personal OS community plugin, you can configure tags that, if present on a file, will make the engage feature consider those files as possible random event. Any file containing those tags can randomly be opened by the engage feature. 
This is useful for quotes your like to see or for possible rewards. This feature makes the engage feature a little more interesting to use.
