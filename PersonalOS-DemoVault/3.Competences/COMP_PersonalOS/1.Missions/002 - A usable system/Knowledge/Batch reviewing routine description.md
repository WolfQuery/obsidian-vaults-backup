# The batch reviewing routine
Once a day, some time is dedicated to review things that you deem important. 
This routine is often underestimated. But it is one of the best way to keep you on track and aligned with your goals and priorities. 
It serves as a daily session to remind yourself of things that you are actively trying to change about your life. For example when trying to assimilate  new habit, before that habit becomes a reflex you might need some recurring reminder of why you want to take on that habit. 
By using an action backlog, this routine offers the flexibility of having different recurrence applied to different things you want to review. By default only one "handled by" file is provided to help you remember to regularly emptying your mind by collecting ideas in your Personal OS system. You might want to add other recurring actions for review for example : 
- Your list of priorities as work to review once a week on Monday
- Your most important current goal to review every day
- A list of book your might want to read to review once a month

Note that will probably change the recurrence on your triggers to review depending on how well you remember them or on their changing importance.
