# Customizing Personal OS core images

A drawing is worth a thousand words, for that reason alone, we use some images through the personal OS system. 
We encourage changing the 4 Core Images as a way to customize your vault. Those are 

- Your avatar Image
- The "Due done" file image
- The "Done" file image
- The "Process done" file image


To change those image, simply go into the corresponding file in edit mode,  remove the link to the existing image, and copy paste any image of your choosing to replace it. Make sure to only remove the link to the image, don't delete the other information in those files ! 

Note that when you paste an image, the image itself is stored in the 9.archives/z.Obsidian Attachment folder. And an embedded link is created in your file. ([Embed files - Obsidian Help](https://help.obsidian.md/Linking+notes+and+files/Embed+files))
