# Customize default theme 

Obsidian offers a vast range of themes created and maintained by the community. But we advise to keep the standard theme. The reason being that most community theme are developed inside vaults without any plugin and it's impossible to ask for those theme developers to take into account the incredible amount of community plugins available for Obsidian. 

But do not worry ! The standard theme still offers a large amount of flexibility to customize your vault appearance, To do so follow the steps bellow : 

- Go to obsidian Settings 
	- By clicking the gear Icon at the bottom right of the left pane
	- Or by opening the command pallet (CTRL+ P) and searching for "Open settings"
- On the left in "Options" select "Appearance"
