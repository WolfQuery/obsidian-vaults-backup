> - Create a new test file and add a timed action, (add a time emoji using ALT+A) with a time 20mn before your current time. schedule it for today by adding a schedule date a move it your activity folder.  The goal is for this file to be the highest priority file in the engage feature. 
> - Add the "Workspace" property to that file and fill it with your test workspace name. 
> - Save your test workspace with the newly  created file as if you don't this specific file won't be opened with your workspace (but you can always find it as the focused file in the Engage dashboard)
> - Use the engage feature and confirm that your test workspace is automatically opened, then delete this test file. 
> - Finally delete your test workspace before finishing this exercise.
