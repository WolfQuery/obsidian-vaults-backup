      - Unlock [[Using PersOS Dashboards]] [level::2]
      - Obtain [[Routine collector]] achievement
      
      ### Your system is online ! You can now practice using it daily, collect what's on your mind, process all those inputs at least once a day, and engage with your activities regularly. Note that even if the system is online, it's currently only partially usable. It'll only be complete when you can trust it, and you will only be able to trust it when it contains everything that is on your mind. Finish the 5 mission ARC to get there !
