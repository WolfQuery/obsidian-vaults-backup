# Goal

> [!important] Goal
>  This course will allow you to practice what is probably the most important skill in any personal organization method : processing your inputs.

>  
>  By the end you'll be able to make a simple file processing, enabling a regular use of the engage feature. 

> [!info] You'll learn
> - **How to use the process feature to streamline processing**
> - **How to categorize a file by using tags**
> - **How to make a file actionable by defining actions**
> - **How to organize files in the folder structure**
