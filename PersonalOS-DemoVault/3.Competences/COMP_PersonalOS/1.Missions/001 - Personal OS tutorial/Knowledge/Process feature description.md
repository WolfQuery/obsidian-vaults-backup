# Introduction

Processing is probably the most important skill in any personal organization method. The goal of processing is to make sure that any input into your system is "handled" in a systematic way, allowing for timely and intelligent retrieval when actions are required or when knowledge is needed. 

## Process feature description 

"Process" is an intelligent script designed to automatically bring to your attention the next file in your system that requires processing. It helps in keeping your system clean without "looking" everywhere to find files that need your attention. 
By default in Personal OS, the system will prompt you to process "late files", then "Inbox files", then "Active files with no actions" ^aun5a8
