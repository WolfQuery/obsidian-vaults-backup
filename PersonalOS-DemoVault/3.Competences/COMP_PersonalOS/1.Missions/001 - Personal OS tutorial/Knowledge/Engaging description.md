Engaging is simply to act on your priorities, may them be previously defined or appearing "on the fly". 

## Key principles for engaging in Personal OS

The way the Personal OS system helps you engage with your priorities is by following some key principles : 
- **Reducing choice overload** : choice overload is the paradoxical effect of choosing between a large number of option,  the decision making process is worst and lead more often to paralysis when the options are too great. In Personal OS we try to prevent "choosing" from task list and take a more automated approach. 
- **Improving engagement through gamification** : using KPIs, dashboards, progress bar, random events, and a large number of other features, the Personal OS system pushes you toward greater reliability. 
- **Productivity through clarity** : by encouraging you keep the system clean and complete, the Personal OS method increases clarity and helps preventing you from feeling overwhelmed, all with the objective to increase your productivity toward your own priorities.
