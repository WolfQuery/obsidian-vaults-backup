Most people are already inclined to collect relevant things in dedicated places. You probably have a box near your door for your keys and you obviously already have an e-mail address. But when it concerns things that are "living" in our mind, people just trust their own mind to do the work. 

Base on the fact that [[The brain is a bad organizing tool|the brain is a bad organizing tool]], it's critical to understand that making a habit of collecting anything that crosses your mind with no direct added value in a dedicated system is not optional but a necessity. In Personal OS, you just create a new file and come back to it later when processing your system.
