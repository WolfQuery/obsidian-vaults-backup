# Introduction

A folder structure is something deeply personal and relates to how we tend to categorize files when that folder is the only categorization tool available. 
People have tried to produce reusable and universal folder structures for example : 
- The PARA system
- The Johnny decimal system
- The ACE or A.C.C.E.S.S system. 

All of them have their advantages and their inconvenient, but some principle are shared. 
In Personal OS, the advised folder structure learns from all those system and tries another approach to organize files. 

# Level 0 Folders
## The inbox folder

The "1.Inbox" folder is here, as its name properly define, as an "Inbox". When ideas come to your mind, when you create new files or notes they automatically go into your Inbox, waiting to be processed.

Note that in the Personal OS plugin, you can configure multiple "Inbox" folders. Those are configured to guide the "Process" feature into looking into those folders when you start a processing activity. 

 Having an Inbox to "regroup" new files that need processing is a crucial habit to help you "fire and forget" anything that comes to mind while keeping focus on your current activity. 

## The activity folder

The "2.Activity" folder is here to contain any folder created in order to organize content around a specific "Activity". In Personal OS we define an activity as an "Action mediating entity", meaning that the principal characteristic of an activity is to mediate actions toward a goal. For example : 

- A project is an activity, it organizes actions toward the project completion goal. 
- A responsibility is an activity, as it organize actions toward a quality standard defined for this responsibility (example : Health)
- A routine is an activity, as it organizes recurring actions toward a desired benefit of that routine
- A task is an activity, as quite like a project it organizes actions toward the task completion goal. 

Note that in the Personal OS plugin, you can configure multiple "Work in progress" folders. Those are here to guide the "Engage" feature and to insure that active files with no actions also come in the "process" feature. 

Regrouping content for a dedicated activity (think project) is extremely natural and instinctive, it's also very useful and helps focusing on a project when referencing this folder. 
## The competences folder

The "3.Competence" folder is here to contain any folder created in order to organize content around a specific "Competence". The OECD defines a competence as : "*as a combination of skills, knowledge, and attitudes that are necessary to effectively perform tasks and solve problems*" . 
We see a competence as a "Template" for an Activity. 
Take a project manager on a house construction project. Every content related to this specific house construction project would be in a project specific folder in the "2.Activities" folder. While every content related to "how to manage a house construction project" would be in a competence specific folder in "3.Competence". 
Some other Examples : 
- Coding in JavaScript is a competence
- Public speaking is a competence
- Project management is a competence
- Money management is a competence

It's very easy to understate the importance of those competence folders. For a knowledge worker, the ability to manage knowledge, tools, or any other content related to a dedicated competence is directly linked to his ability to consistently perform at a high level but also to teach others how to perform at the highest level. It also encourages the creation of "reusable assets" that can be used through his professional or personal life.
