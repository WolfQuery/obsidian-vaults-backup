This is probably the single most important principle to succeed in anything. To do anything properly you have to focus on it. To focus on it you have to prevent your mind from wandering. You have to understand that your brain has not evolved to manage 50 different priorities at the same time. It will randomly remind you of things a lot more than you need, and often not at the right time. (You’ll always remember that you need batteries when your unworking remote is in your hand, not when you’re at the store). 

**Accepting that your brain is the worst possible organization tool that you have is the a necessary step to getting organized**.
