# Dashboards descriptions

## The Engage dashboard

The Engage dashboard is probably the most used dashboard as it should be open anytime you are engaging with the system to actually perform tasks. It gives you an overview of useful information related to your work load for the current day.  ^uv0179
## The Process dashboard

The Process dashboard presents useful information when processing the system. It gives you an overview of your processing load and of your subject load for the times to come, helping you in scheduling files for appropriate times.  ^rqckko
