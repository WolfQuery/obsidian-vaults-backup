# Inbox files

Inbox files are simply in one of the "Inbox" folders that can be configured in Personal OS plugin settings.  By default, the 1.Inbox folder is used to  that end. Every newly created file is also automatically created in that folder.  ^m7l3eh

# Active file with no actions

Active files are files contained in a "Work in progress folder", those can be configured in the Personal OS plugin settings. By default the 2.Activities folder is used to that end. 
As a rule in Personal OS, every active file should either contain an action or be archived.  ^cxlqbg
