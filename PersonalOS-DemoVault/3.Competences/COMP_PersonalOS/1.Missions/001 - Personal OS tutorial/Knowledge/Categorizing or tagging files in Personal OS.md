# Introduction

Personal OS uses a "Tag" system to categorize files. Those tags represent what the file  "is" or what the file "represents". 
A file before processing is just an Input, it's just "Stuff" with no identity. The idea of "defining" what a file "Is" is to be able to then create sub-systems adapted to the handling of those types of files. It's not an obligation to add a tag to a file, try and use the tags you know and master, for the rest, not using tags is fine.  ^p63h8r
