## Introduction 

An "Inbox" is any tool designed to contain items that are waiting to be processed. And this concept is not restrained to your organization system or even to digital tools. Anything you "collect" would go into an inbox. You already have a large number of them to collect various types of things that requires you attention.  ^2g35jc

## Managing inboxes is no longer optional
30 years ago, the natural number of inboxes that any knowledge worker had was very low compared to today's standards. The multiplication of tools to handle the complex professional environment today brought both an improved productivity and and deeper need to manage how we invest our attention. 
Just take a moment to pause and reflect on the multiple inboxes that you might have. for example : 
- Personal E-mail Inbox
- Professional E-mail Inbox
- Physical Mail box
- Facebook/Instagram DMs, 
- SMS Inbox. 
- Various Chat application (WhatsApp, MS teams, Google talk, etc)
- Readwise lists
- Youtube "watch later" list / youtube subscriptions new videos

I believe you get the idea, we now have an extremely large amount of different inboxes that we regularly need to "empty". 
In personal OS, we retain 2 major rules : 
- **Inboxes number should be kept to a minimum.** 
	- **Refuse some Inbox of merge some when possible**
- **Each Inbox should be completely emptied as rarely as possible**
	- **Not all inboxes need to be emptied everyday or multiple times a day**
