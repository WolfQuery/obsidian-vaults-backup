Inspired on various other productivity methods (GTD, Atomic Habit, Deep Work, Kanban ...). 

# Simple description

The Personal OS workflow is very simple, it's composed of 3 classes of activities : 
- **Engaging** : to act on what you decided to do
- **Collecting** : to gather what need your attention and keep your mind clear
- **Processing** : to clarify what needs to be done and insure timely retrieval

You will usually dedicate specific time for each activity, but the separation between those is not that strict. For example, you might think of an idea while working on a project, and quickly collect that idea when it comes to mind.
