# Introduction

A famous quote by David Allen, author of _Getting Things Done (GTD)_, is: "Your mind is for having ideas, not holding them." This quote emphasizes that your brain is one of the worst organizing systems. The more you keep in your mind, the more anxious, less focused, and less reliable you become. An average person can hold up to 200 different ideas, constantly gnawing at their attention.
The habit of collection is the first step to combat this. Instead of keeping ideas in your mind, store them in your personal OS system. Once this becomes a reflex, you will have taken your first step toward best-in-class self-management.   ^ucoi5u
