## Ways to add actions

- Use the hotkey **"CTRL + L" (Control Action list)**  2 times
- Right-click on a file line and selecting "Paragraph/Task list"
- Type "- [ ] " (there is a space after the dash, between the 2 brackets, and another after the brackets) at the start of a line
- Use the command palette (CTRL+P) and search for "Toggle checkbox status"


## Ways to add properties to an action

- Use the "tasks plugin" autocompletion by typing the first 2 or 3 letter of what you want to add 
- Use the watch emoji to add time (only used by personal OS plugin)
- Use dataview inline properties between brackets.
