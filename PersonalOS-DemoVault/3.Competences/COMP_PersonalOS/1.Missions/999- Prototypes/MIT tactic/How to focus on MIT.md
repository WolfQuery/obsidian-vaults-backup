- Brainstorm a list of task for the day, can check the due widget if necessary. 
- Define the MIT : 
	- Either create a new file or use an existing file in due
	- put a high priority on it or even better but a time so it's first in the Engage algo
	- Book time in  your the calendar to do it, the earliest in the day the best it is
	- Make sure your environment is ready for it
- This file should be low or normal priority for the day to validate that MIT was done, 
- Once MIT is done, either choose another task in the list, or process all actions in seperate files then archive this one 

Focusing on the most important task can be challenging, but with the right strategies, you can build the discipline and environment to make it easier. Here’s how:

1. **Define Your MIT (Most Important Task) Clearly**: Start by identifying your most important task for the day. Make sure you know exactly what it entails and why it matters to your goals. Writing it down or stating it as a clear, actionable item can sharpen your focus on completing it.
2. **Break It Down**: If the task feels overwhelming, break it into smaller, manageable steps. Having a clear starting point can reduce procrastination and make the task less intimidating.
3. **Set a Dedicated Time Block**: Schedule a specific time in your day when you’re most focused (often in the morning) and dedicate it solely to the MIT. Treat this time as a non-negotiable appointment, giving it the same priority as any other important commitment.
5. **Eliminate Distractions**: Create an environment conducive to focus by removing common distractions, such as turning off notifications, closing unrelated tabs, or using focus apps to block distracting websites. Even physical clutter can impact concentration, so keep your workspace organized.
6. **Practice Single-Tasking**: Resist the urge to multitask, as it divides your attention and decreases the quality of your work. Commit to single-tasking by working on just your MIT during your designated time, only moving on once it’s complete or you’ve made significant progress.
7. **Start with a Mini-Win**: Sometimes, just starting a small part of the task can build momentum. Set a micro-goal, such as spending only 5 minutes on the task initially. This often leads to you staying on track for longer once you get into the flow.
8. **Reframe Your Mindset**: Rather than seeing the MIT as something you “have to do,” reframe it as something you “choose to do” because it aligns with your goals. This mental shift can reduce resistance and make the task feel less like a chore.
