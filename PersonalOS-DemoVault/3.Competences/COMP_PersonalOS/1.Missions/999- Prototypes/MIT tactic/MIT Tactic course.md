## Use MIT Tactic

> [!success] In practice
> Use the MIT tactic and follow instruction until you actually finish your most important task for the day. Keep it simple ! Your MIT today does not need to be complex,  take extra precaution to actually finish it before the end of the day. 
> **Remember to use the Engage feature (ALT +1)** along the way, especially once your MIT is scheduled. 

- [ ] Go to the skill, launch the tactic and follow the instructions. Complete this action only if you finished scheduling your MIT. 

The tactic can be found here : [[Focusing on MIT]]
