## Process to delegate a file

- Define what that resource is by adding a tag in the "tags" property, you will usually delegate an activity
- Optionally fill the "context" property of the delegated file (is it part of a project for example ? or is it part of one of your responsibility that you are sharing ?)
- If needed use the "@Agent" template to create an agent to delegate the file to, note that in Personal OS, any agent file starts with a "@"
- Use the "Delegated To" property to link to the delegated agent. 
- Ensure that you have at least follow-up action to verify that the delegated file was correctly handled.  
- Move the delegated file to one of your 2.Activity folder
- Obviously don't forget to communicate to that agent that you delegated something to him ;)
