# Introduction

A core concept of delegating that most people forget is that the only reason that you delegate something to someone is because you still share some of the responsibility for the result. 
Keeping that in mind, when you delegate something, you should still follow in your personal system the actions needed to ensure the desired result.  ^7wyiu6
