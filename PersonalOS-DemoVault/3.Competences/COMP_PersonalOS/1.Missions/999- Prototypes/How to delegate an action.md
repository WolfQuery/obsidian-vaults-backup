## Process to delegate an action

- Simply link that action to an agent file (agent files should all start with an @)
- Make sure to still schedule a follow-up on that delegation
- Example : Finish the kick-off presentation [[@John]] , follow-up on it ‚è≥ 2024-11-24 
- Obviously don't forget to communicate to that agent that you delegated something to him ;)
