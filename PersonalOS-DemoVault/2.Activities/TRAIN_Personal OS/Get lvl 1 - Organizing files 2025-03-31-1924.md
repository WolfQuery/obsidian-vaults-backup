A folder structure is something deeply personal and relates to how we tend to categorize files when that folder is the only categorization tool available. 
People have tried to produce reusable and universal folder structures for example : 
- The PARA system
- The Johnny decimal system
- The ACE or A.C.C.E.S.S system. 

All of them have their advantages and their disadvantages, but some principle are shared. 
In Personal OS, the advised folder structure learns from all those systems and tries another approach to organize files. 

In this exercise, the goal is to make you understand the "Core folders" of the methodology. We would advise you to keep that core intact for a time and to get really acquainted with the method before modifying it. 

The core folders in Personal OS are : 
- 1.Inbox
- 2.Activities
- 3.Competences

# Resources and Archives folders

## The Resources folder

The resource folder is here to organize any content that does not fall either under an activity or a competence. No need to overly think about what to put there. 

## The Archives folder

The archives folder is here to contain any folder that you want to keep but would probably never use again. For example an old project folder that has been finished can go into the archive folder, a competence folder that you know you will probably never use again can also go there. 


# Move files to the right folder

> [!info]
> For now, it's a lot of knowledge for a simple action, while processing a new file, you need to "move" that file to another folder. 
> Don't dwell on it too much. Remember that by default only the "2.Activity" is a "Work in progress folder". So when moving an "Actionable" file, try to move it into an Activity sub-folder. If it is content that can be reused in the context of an activity, move it to a competence folder. If everything else fail, move it to a resources folder.
