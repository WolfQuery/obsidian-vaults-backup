> [!tip] 
> Projects are usually very good targets for other files "context" property ! 
> Large responsibility are also very good targets for other files "context" property, remember that any "project" that you can think of that does not have an end date is a responsibility. So they can also be active and require actions. 

> [!success] In practice
> ### If you have done a mind sweep and reserved files for processing 
> - Check the "2.Activity" folder and look for already created projects folders or files
> - Look for 3 to 4 candidate files from your mind sweep that can represent a task or a sub-project for those projects
> - Process them and add the "Context" property, referencing their relevant project 
> - Check in the project file how those newly created files are appearing in the Activity tree and in the context tree
> ### Else
> - Create a new file and apply the project template to it
> - Create another file and fill the "context" property with a link to the project just created
> - Check in the project file how those newly created files are appearing in the Activity tree and in the context tree
> - Delete the newly created files to keep your system clean
