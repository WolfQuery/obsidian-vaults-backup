![[Categorizing or tagging files in Personal OS#^p63h8r]]

When processing, the first step is to ask yourself  "what is this file ?" Example of answers are : 
- A quote I like and I need to review
- A meeting note I need to use for a quick report
- An interesting photo I'd like to review when buying my next car
- A goal I have regarding my hobby

**As an introduction to this practice, only 4 tags are advised :** 
- **Task**
- **Routine**
- **Project**
- **Goal**

Tags can be added anywhere in a file, but to streamline file identification we use the "tags" property (for example this file currently have the tag #Exercise )
> [!success] In practice
> Create a new file, add the tags property and add the "Task" tag in the "tags" property. Then delete the test file before finishing this exercise.

> ![[How to add properties to a file#Ways to add properties to a file]]

> [!tip]
> To add a tag anywhere outside the tag property, start by typing "#" then type the name of the tag. 
> Files are also retrievable by tags by using the tag explorer (left pane near the file explorer menu button).
