> [!success] In practice
> ### If you have done a mind sweep and reserved files for processing 
> - Look for 3 to 4 candidate files from your mind sweep that can represent a global resource
> - Process them and add them to a relevant folder in 4.Resources
> - Check in the file tree to make sure you find them back
> ### Else
> - Create a new file and add the tag "Quote" in the "tags" property
> - Create a "RESO_Quotes" subfolder in the 4.Resources folder
> - Find a nice quote that you like and write it in the file :)
> - Move that quote to the newly created folder
