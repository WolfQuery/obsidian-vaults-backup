>Tyche (pronounced TIE-key) was the original goddess of fortune. An ancient goddess, she was originally a member of the Greek pantheon before falling out of favor and eventualy leaving. She made her way to Abeir-Toril where joined the Netherese Pantheon. She would eventually split into [[z_Examples/Compendium/Lore example/Deities/Tymora#Tymora]] (goddess of good luck) and [[z_Examples/Compendium/Lore example/Deities/Beshaba#Beshaba]] (goddess of misfortune) during the [[Compendium/Lore/Events/Dawn Cataclysm#Dawn Cataclysm]].
