>![[dawncataclysm.jpg|right wm-sm]]The Dawn Cataclysm was an attempt by the god [[Compendium/Lore/Deities/Lathander#Lathander]] to reshape the pantheon of deities more in his own image. It is unknown when this event occurred but it ultimately failed, resulting in the destruction of several deities (e.g. [[Compendium/Lore/Deities/Tyche#Tyche]] splitting into [[Compendium/Lore/Deities/Tymora#Tymora]] and [[Compendium/Lore/Deities/Beshaba#Beshaba]]).
