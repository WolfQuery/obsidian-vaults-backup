## Traits

***Stony Lethargy.*** When a creature the construct can see starts its turn within 10 feet of the construct, the construct can force it to make a Wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC. On a failed save, the target can't use reactions and its speed is halved until the start of its next turn.

## Actions

***Multiattack.*** The construct makes a number of attacks equal to half this spell's level (rounded down).

***Slam.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* `YourSpellAttack` to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* `1d8 + 4` + the spell's level bludgeoning damage.
