## Traits

***Hellish Weapons.*** The erinyes's weapon attacks are magical and deal an extra 13 (`3d8`) poison damage on a hit (included in the attacks).

***Magic Resistance.*** The erinyes has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

***Special Equipment.*** The erinyes carries a rope of entanglement.

## Actions

***Multiattack.*** The erinyes makes three attacks. It can use its rope of entanglement in place of two of the attacks.

***Longsword.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* `+8` to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 8 (`1d8 + 4`) slashing damage, or 9 (`1d10 + 4`) slashing damage if used with two hands, plus 13 (`3d8`) poison damage.

***Longbow.*** *Ranged Weapon Attack:* `+7` to hit, range 150/600 ft., one target. *Hit:* 7 (`1d8 + 3`) piercing damage plus 13 (`3d8`) poison damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw or be [poisoned](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Poisoned). The poison lasts until it is removed by the [lesser restoration](3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/lesser-restoration.md) spell or similar magic.

## Reactions

***Parry.*** The erinyes adds 4 to its AC against one melee attack that would hit it. To do so, the erinyes must see the attacker and be wielding a melee weapon.
