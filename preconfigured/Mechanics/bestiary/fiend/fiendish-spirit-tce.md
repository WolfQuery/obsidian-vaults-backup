## Traits

***Magic Resistance.*** The fiend has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

***Death Throes (Demon Only).*** When the fiend drops to 0 hit points or the spell ends, the fiend explodes, and each creature within 10 feet of it must make a Dexterity saving throw against your spell save DC. A creature takes `2d10` + the spell's level fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

***Devil's Sight (Devil Only).*** Magical darkness doesn't impede the fiend's darkvision.

## Actions

***Multiattack.*** The fiend makes a number of attacks equal to half this spell's level (rounded down).

***Bite (Demon Only).*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* `YourSpellAttack` to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* `1d12 + 3` + the spell's level necrotic damage.

***Claws (Yugoloth Only).*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* `YourSpellAttack` to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* `1d8 + 3` + the spell's level slashing damage. Immediately after the attack hits or misses, the fiend can magically teleport up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space it can see.

***Hurl Flame (Devil Only).*** *Ranged Spell Attack:* `YourSpellAttack` to hit, range 150 ft., one target. *Hit:* `2d6 + 3` + the spell's level fire damage. If the target is a flammable object that isn't being worn or carried, it also catches fire.
