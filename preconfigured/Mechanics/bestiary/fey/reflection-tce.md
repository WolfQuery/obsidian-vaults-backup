## Traits

***Amorphous.*** The reflection can move through a space as narrow as 1 inch wide without squeezing.

***Shadow Stealth.*** While in dim light or darkness, the reflection can take the Hide action as a bonus action. Its stealth bonus is also improved to +6.

***Sunlight Weakness.*** While in sunlight, the reflection has disadvantage on attack rolls, ability checks, and saving throws.

## Actions

***Strength Drain.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* `+4` to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. *Hit:* 9 (`2d6 + 2`) necrotic damage, and the target's Strength score is reduced by `1d4`. The target dies if this reduces its Strength to 0. Otherwise, the reduction lasts until the target finishes a short or long rest.

If a non-evil humanoid dies from this attack, a new reflection rises from the corpse `1d4` hours later.
