## Traits

***Amphibious.*** The marid can breathe air and water.

***Elemental Demise.*** If the marid dies, its body disintegrates into a burst of water and foam, leaving behind only equipment the marid was wearing or carrying.

***Disguises.*** Some genies can veil themselves in illusion to pass as other similarly shaped creatures. Such genies can innately cast the [disguise self](3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/disguise-self.md) spell at will, often with a longer duration than is normal for that spell. Mightier genies can cast the [true polymorph](3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/true-polymorph.md) spell one to three times per day, possibly with a longer duration than normal. Such genies can change only their own shape, but a rare few can use the spell on other creatures and objects as well.

***Innate Spellcasting.*** The marid's innate spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 16, `+8` to hit with spell attacks). It can innately cast the following spells, requiring no material components:

**At will**: [create or destroy water](3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/create-or-destroy-water.md), [detect evil and good](3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/detect-evil-and-good.md), [detect magic](3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/detect-magic.md), [fog cloud](3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/fog-cloud.md), [purify food and drink](3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/purify-food-and-drink.md), [disguise self](3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/disguise-self.md) (often with a longer duration than is normal for that spell; see Disguises)

**1/day each**: [conjure elemental](3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/conjure-elemental.md) ([water elemental](3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/elemental/water-elemental.md) only), [control water](3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/control-water.md), [gaseous form](3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/gaseous-form.md), [invisibility](3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/invisibility.md), [plane shift](3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/plane-shift.md)

**3/day each**: [tongues](3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/tongues.md), [water breathing](3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/water-breathing.md), [water walk](3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/water-walk.md), [true polymorph](3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/true-polymorph.md) (mightier genies only; see Disguises)

## Actions

***Multiattack.*** The marid makes two trident attacks.

***Trident.*** *Melee or Ranged Weapon Attack:* `+10` to hit, reach 5 ft. or range 20/60 ft., one target. *Hit:* 13 (`2d6 + 6`) piercing damage, or 15 (`2d8 + 6`) piercing damage if used with two hands to make a melee attack.

***Water Jet.*** The marid magically shoots water in a 60-foot line that is 5 feet wide. Each creature in that line must make a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw. On a failure, a target takes 21 (`6d6`) bludgeoning damage and, if it is Huge or smaller, is pushed up to 20 feet away from the marid and knocked [prone](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Prone). On a success, a target takes half the bludgeoning damage, but is neither pushed nor knocked [prone](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Prone).
