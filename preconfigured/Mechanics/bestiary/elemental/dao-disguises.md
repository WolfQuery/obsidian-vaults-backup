## Traits

***Earth Glide.*** The dao can burrow through nonmagical, unworked earth and stone. While doing so, the dao doesn't disturb the material it moves through.

***Elemental Demise.*** If the dao dies, its body disintegrates into crystalline powder, leaving behind only equipment the dao was wearing or carrying.

***Sure-Footed.*** The dao has advantage on Strength and Dexterity saving throws made against effects that would knock it [prone](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Prone).

***Disguises.*** Some genies can veil themselves in illusion to pass as other similarly shaped creatures. Such genies can innately cast the [disguise self](3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/disguise-self.md) spell at will, often with a longer duration than is normal for that spell. Mightier genies can cast the [true polymorph](3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/true-polymorph.md) spell one to three times per day, possibly with a longer duration than normal. Such genies can change only their own shape, but a rare few can use the spell on other creatures and objects as well.

***Innate Spellcasting.*** The dao's innate spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 14, `+6` to hit with spell attacks). It can innately cast the following spells, requiring no material components:

**At will**: [detect evil and good](3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/detect-evil-and-good.md), [detect magic](3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/detect-magic.md), [stone shape](3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/stone-shape.md), [disguise self](3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/disguise-self.md) (often with a longer duration than is normal for that spell; see Disguises)

**1/day each**: [conjure elemental](3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/conjure-elemental.md) ([earth elemental](3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/elemental/earth-elemental.md) only), [gaseous form](3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/gaseous-form.md), [invisibility](3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/invisibility.md), [phantasmal killer](3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/phantasmal-killer.md), [plane shift](3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/plane-shift.md), [wall of stone](3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/wall-of-stone.md)

**3/day each**: [passwall](3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/passwall.md), [move earth](3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/move-earth.md), [tongues](3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/tongues.md), [true polymorph](3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/true-polymorph.md) (mightier genies only; see Disguises)

## Actions

***Multiattack.*** The Dao makes two fist attacks or two maul attacks.

***Fist.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* `+10` to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 15 (`2d8 + 6`) bludgeoning damage.

***Maul.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* `+10` to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 20 (`4d6 + 6`) bludgeoning damage. If the target is a Huge or smaller creature, it must succeed on a DC 18 Strength check or be knocked [prone](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Prone).
