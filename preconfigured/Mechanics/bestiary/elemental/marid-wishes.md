## Traits

***Amphibious.*** The marid can breathe air and water.

***Elemental Demise.*** If the marid dies, its body disintegrates into a burst of water and foam, leaving behind only equipment the marid was wearing or carrying.

***Wishes.*** The genie power to grant wishes is legendary among mortals. Only the most potent genies, such as those among the nobility, can do so. A particular genie that has this power can grant one to three wishes to a creature that isn't a genie. Once a genie has granted its limit of wishes, it can't grant wishes again for some amount of time (usually 1 year), and cosmic law dictates that the same genie can expend its limit of wishes on a specific creature only once in that creature's existence.

To be granted a wish, a creature within 60 feet of the genie states a desired effect to it. The genie can then cast the [wish](3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/wish.md) spell on the creature's behalf to bring about the effect. Depending on the genie's nature, the genie might try to pervert the intent of the wish by exploiting the wish's poor wording. The perversion of the wording is usually crafted to be to the genie's benefit.

***Innate Spellcasting.*** The marid's innate spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 16, `+8` to hit with spell attacks). It can innately cast the following spells, requiring no material components:

**At will**: [create or destroy water](3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/create-or-destroy-water.md), [detect evil and good](3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/detect-evil-and-good.md), [detect magic](3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/detect-magic.md), [fog cloud](3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/fog-cloud.md), [purify food and drink](3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/purify-food-and-drink.md)

**1/day each**: [conjure elemental](3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/conjure-elemental.md) ([water elemental](3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/elemental/water-elemental.md) only), [control water](3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/control-water.md), [gaseous form](3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/gaseous-form.md), [invisibility](3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/invisibility.md), [plane shift](3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/plane-shift.md)

**3/day each**: [tongues](3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/tongues.md), [water breathing](3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/water-breathing.md), [water walk](3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/water-walk.md)

## Actions

***Multiattack.*** The marid makes two trident attacks.

***Trident.*** *Melee or Ranged Weapon Attack:* `+10` to hit, reach 5 ft. or range 20/60 ft., one target. *Hit:* 13 (`2d6 + 6`) piercing damage, or 15 (`2d8 + 6`) piercing damage if used with two hands to make a melee attack.

***Water Jet.*** The marid magically shoots water in a 60-foot line that is 5 feet wide. Each creature in that line must make a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw. On a failure, a target takes 21 (`6d6`) bludgeoning damage and, if it is Huge or smaller, is pushed up to 20 feet away from the marid and knocked [prone](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Prone). On a success, a target takes half the bludgeoning damage, but is neither pushed nor knocked [prone](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Prone).
