## Traits

***Amphibious.*** The frog can breathe air and water.

***Standing Leap.*** The frog's long jump is up to 20 feet and its high jump is up to 10 feet, with or without a running start.

## Actions

***Bite.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* `+3` to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 4 (`1d6 + 1`) piercing damage, and the target is [grappled](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Grappled) (escape DC 11). Until this grapple ends, the target is [restrained](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Restrained), and the frog can't bite another target.

***Swallow.*** The frog makes one bite attack against a Small or smaller target it is grappling. If the attack hits, the target is swallowed, and the grapple ends. The swallowed target is [blinded](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Blinded) and [restrained](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Restrained), it has total cover against attacks and other effects outside the frog, and it takes 5 (`2d4`) acid damage at the start of each of the frog's turns. The frog can have only one target swallowed at a time. If the frog dies, a swallowed creature is no longer [restrained](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Restrained) by it and can escape from the corpse using 5 feet of movement, exiting [prone](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Prone).
