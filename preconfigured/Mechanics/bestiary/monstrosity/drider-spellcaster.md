## Traits

***Fey Ancestry.*** The drider has advantage on saving throws against being [charmed](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Charmed), and magic can't put the drider to sleep.

***Spider Climb.*** The drider can climb difficult surfaces, including upside down on ceilings, without needing to make an ability check.

***Sunlight Sensitivity.*** While in sunlight, the drider has disadvantage on attack rolls, as well as on Wisdom ([Perception](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Perception)) checks that rely on sight.

***Web Walker.*** The drider ignores movement restrictions caused by webbing.

***Spellcasting.*** The drider is a 7th-level spellcaster. Its spellcasting ability is Wisdom (spell save DC 14, `+6` to hit with spell attacks). The drider has the following spells prepared from the cleric spell list:

**Cantrips (at will)**: [poison spray](3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/poison-spray.md), [thaumaturgy](3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/thaumaturgy.md)

**1st level (4 slots)**: [bane](3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/bane.md), [detect magic](3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/detect-magic.md), [sanctuary](3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/sanctuary.md)

**2nd level (3 slots)**: [hold person](3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/hold-person.md), [silence](3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/silence.md)

**3rd level (3 slots)**: [clairvoyance](3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/clairvoyance.md), [dispel magic](3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/dispel-magic.md)

**4th level (2 slots)**: [divination](3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/divination.md), [freedom of movement](3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/freedom-of-movement.md)

## Actions

***Multiattack.*** The drider makes three attacks, either with its longsword or its longbow. It can replace one of those attacks with a bite attack.

***Longsword.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* `+6` to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 7 (`1d8 + 3`) slashing damage, or 8 (`1d10 + 3`) slashing damage if used with two hands.
