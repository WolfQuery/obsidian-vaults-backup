## Traits

***Amphibious.*** The grung can breathe air and water.

***Poisonous Skin.*** A creature [poisoned](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Poisoned) by a grung suffers an additional effect that depends on the grung's color. This effect lasts until the creature is no longer [poisoned](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Poisoned) by the grung. The creature is [charmed](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Charmed) by the grung and can speak Grung.

***Standing Leap.*** The grung's long jump is up to 25 feet and its high jump is up to 15 feet, with or without a running start.

***Water Dependency.*** If the grung isn't immersed in water for at least 1 hour during a day, it suffers 1 level of [exhaustion](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Exhaustion) at the end of that day. The grung can recover from this [exhaustion](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Exhaustion) only through magic or by immersing itself in water for at least 1 hour.

## Actions

***Dagger.*** *Melee or Ranged Weapon Attack:* `+4` to hit, reach 5 ft. or range 20/60 ft., one target. *Hit:* 4 (`1d4 + 2`) piercing damage plus 5 (`2d4`) poison damage.
