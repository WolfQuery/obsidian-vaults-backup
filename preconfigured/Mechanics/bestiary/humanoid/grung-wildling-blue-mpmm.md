## Traits

***Amphibious.*** The grung can breathe air and water.

***Poisonous Skin.*** A creature [poisoned](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Poisoned) by a grung suffers an additional effect that depends on the grung's color. This effect lasts until the creature is no longer [poisoned](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Poisoned) by the grung. The [poisoned](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Poisoned) creature must make a loud noise at the start and end of its turn.

***Standing Leap.*** The grung's long jump is up to 25 feet and its high jump is up to 15 feet, with or without a running start.

***Water Dependency.*** If the grung isn't immersed in water for at least 1 hour during a day, it suffers 1 level of [exhaustion](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Exhaustion) at the end of that day. The grung can recover from this [exhaustion](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Exhaustion) only through magic or by immersing itself in water for at least 1 hour.

***Spellcasting.*** The grung casts one of the following spells, using Wisdom as the spellcasting ability (spell save DC 12):

**At will**: [druidcraft](3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/druidcraft.md)

**2/day**: [plant growth](3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/plant-growth.md)

**3/day each**: [cure wounds](3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/cure-wounds.md), [spike growth](3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/spike-growth.md)
