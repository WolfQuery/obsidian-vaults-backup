# Grung Elite Warrior
*Source: Mordenkainen Presents: Monsters of the Multiverse p. 150*  

A grung elite warrior typically leads a group of grung and other warriors into battle and is often accompanied by a grung wildling.

## Grungs

Grungs are frog-like folk found in rain forests and tropical jungles. These amphibians prefer shade and live in trees, but they maintain hatcheries for their offspring in well-guarded ground-level pools. About three months after hatching, a grung tadpole takes on the shape of an adult, and after another six months, the grung reaches maturity.

Born in a wide range of colors, grungs most often appear in shades of green, blue, purple, red, orange, and gold. All grungs secrete a substance that is harmless to them but poisonous to other creatures, and sometimes that substance has a special effect based on the grung's color (see "Variant: Grung Poison"). They also use this venom to poison their weapons.

## Traits

***Amphibious.*** The grung can breathe air and water.

***Poisonous Skin.*** Any creature that grapples the grung or otherwise comes into direct contact with the grung's skin must succeed on a DC 12 Constitution saving throw or become [poisoned](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Poisoned) for 1 minute. A [poisoned](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Poisoned) creature no longer in direct contact with the grung can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

***Standing Leap.*** The grung's long jump is up to 25 feet and its high jump is up to 15 feet, with or without a running start.

***Water Dependency.*** If the grung isn't immersed in water for at least 1 hour during a day, it suffers 1 level of [exhaustion](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Exhaustion) at the end of that day. The grung can recover from this [exhaustion](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Exhaustion) only through magic or by immersing itself in water for at least 1 hour.

## Actions

***Dagger.*** *Melee or Ranged Weapon Attack:* `+5` to hit, reach 5 ft. or range 20/60 ft., one target. *Hit:* 5 (`1d4 + 3`) piercing damage plus 5 (`2d4`) poison damage.

***Shortbow.*** *Ranged Weapon Attack:* `+5` to hit, range 80/320 ft., one target. *Hit:* 6 (`1d6 + 3`) piercing damage plus 5 (`2d4`) poison damage.

***Mesmerizing Chirr (Recharge 6).*** The grung makes a chirring noise to which grungs are immune. Each Humanoid or Beast that is within 15 feet of the grung and able to hear it must succeed on a DC 12 Wisdom saving throw or be [stunned](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Stunned) until the end of the grung's next turn.
