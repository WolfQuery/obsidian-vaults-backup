# Noble
*Source: Monster Manual p. 348, Waterdeep: Dragon Heist. Available in the <span title='Systems Reference Document (5.1)'>SRD</span>*  

Nobles wield great authority and influence as members of the upper class, possessing wealth and connections that can make them as powerful as monarchs and generals. A noble often travels in the company of guards, as well as servants who are commoners.

The noble's statistics can also be used to represent courtiers who aren't of noble birth.
