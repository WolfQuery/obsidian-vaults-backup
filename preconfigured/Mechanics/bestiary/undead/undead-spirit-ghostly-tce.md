## Actions

***Multiattack.*** The spirit makes a number of attacks equal to half this spell's level (rounded down).

***Deathly Touch.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* `YourSpellAttack` to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. *Hit:* `1d8 + 3` + the spell's level necrotic damage, and the creature must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC or be [frightened](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Frightened) of the undead until the end of the target's next turn.
