## Traits

***Amorphous.*** The ooze can move through a space as narrow as 1 inch wide without squeezing.

***Corrode Metal.*** Any nonmagical weapon made of metal that hits the ooze corrodes. After dealing damage, the weapon takes a permanent and cumulative −1 penalty to damage rolls. If its penalty drops to −5, the weapon is destroyed. Nonmagical ammunition made of metal that hits the ooze is destroyed after dealing damage.

The ooze can eat through 2-inch-thick, nonmagical metal in 1 round.

***False Appearance.*** While the ooze remains motionless, it is indistinguishable from an oily pool or wet rock.

## Actions

***Pseudopod.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* `+3` to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 4 (`1d6 + 1`) bludgeoning damage plus 7 (`2d6`) acid damage, and if the target is wearing nonmagical metal armor, its armor is partly corroded and takes a permanent and cumulative −1 penalty to the AC it offers. The armor is destroyed if the penalty reduces its AC to 10.

***Psychic Crush (Recharge 5-6).*** The ooze targets one creature that it can sense within 60 feet of it. The target must make a DC 10 Intelligence saving throw, taking 10 (`3d6`) psychic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
