## Traits

***Devil's Sight.*** Magical darkness doesn't impede Osvaldo's darkvision.

***Magic Resistance.*** Osvaldo has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

## Actions

***Multiattack.*** Osvaldo makes two attacks with its chains.

***Chain.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* `+8` to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. *Hit:* 11 (`2d6 + 4`) slashing damage. The target is [grappled](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Grappled) (escape DC 14) if Osvaldo isn't already grappling a creature. Until this grapple ends, the target is [restrained](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Restrained) and takes 7 (`2d6`) piercing damage at the start of each of its turns.

***Animate Chains (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest).*** Up to four chains Osvaldo can see within 60 feet of it magically sprout razor-edged barbs and animate under Osvaldo's control, provided that the chains aren't being worn or carried.

Each animated chain is an object with AC 20, 20 hit points, resistance to piercing damage, and immunity to psychic and thunder damage. When Osvaldo uses Multiattack on its turn, it can use each animated chain to make one additional chain attack. An animated chain can grapple one creature of its own but can't make attacks while grappling. An animated chain reverts to its inanimate state if reduced to 0 hit points or if Osvaldo is [incapacitated](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Incapacitated) or dies.

## Reactions

***Unnerving Mask.*** When a creature Osvaldo can see starts its turn within 30 feet of Osvaldo, Osvaldo can create the illusion that it looks like one of the creature's departed loved ones or bitter enemies. If the creature can see Osvaldo, it must succeed on a DC 14 Wisdom saving throw or be [frightened](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Frightened) until the end of its turn.
