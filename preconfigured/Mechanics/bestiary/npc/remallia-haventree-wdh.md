# Remallia Haventree
*Source: Waterdeep: Dragon Heist p. 214*  

Remallia (Remi to her friends) is the lady of House Ulbrinter and a guiding light for the Harpers in Waterdeep

She became an active force for good in the city after assassins killed her husband, Arthagast Ulbrinter, and destroyed his remains. A sun elf, she has two adult children (a half-elf son named Arthius, who is studying music in Silverymoon, and a half-elf daughter named Serenore, who lives on the Moonshae island of Alaron with her husband and daughter). Lady Haventree retains a handful of loyal servants and spies.

Remi holds secret Harper meetings in her villa, which is warded by all manner of spells. She uses a silver raven figurine of wondrous power to deliver messages to Harper spies scattered throughout the city.

## Traits

***Special Equipment.*** Remallia has a figurine of wondrous power (silver raven).

***Fey Ancestry.*** Remallia has advantage on saving throws against being [charmed](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Charmed), and magic can't put her to sleep.

***Arcane Ward.*** Remallia has a magical ward that has 30 hit points. Whenever she takes damage, the ward takes the damage instead. If the ward is reduced to 0 hit points, Remallia takes any remaining damage.
