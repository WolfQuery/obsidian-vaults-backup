# Stone Shape
*4th-level, Transmutation*  

- **Casting time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Touch
- **Components:** V, S, soft clay, which must be worked into roughly the desired shape of the stone object
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

You touch a stone object of Medium size or smaller or a section of stone no more than 5 feet in any dimension and form it into any shape that suits your purpose. So, for example, you could shape a large rock into a weapon, idol, or coffer, or make a small passage through a wall, as long as the wall is less than 5 feet thick. You could also shape a stone door or its frame to seal the door shut. The object you create can have up to two hinges and a latch, but finer mechanical detail isn't possible.

**Classes**: [Artificer](list-spells-classes-artificer); [Bard](list-spells-classes-bard); [Cleric](list-spells-classes-cleric); [Druid](list-spells-classes-druid); [Wizard](list-spells-classes-wizard); [Rogue (Arcane Trickster)](list-spells-classes-rogue-arcane-trickster); [Druid (Circle of the Land)](list-spells-classes-druid-circle-of-the-land); [Sorcerer (Divine Soul)](list-spells-classes-sorcerer-divine-soul-xge); [Fighter (Eldritch Knight)](list-spells-classes-fighter-eldritch-knight); [Warlock (The Genie)](list-spells-classes-warlock-the-genie-tce)
