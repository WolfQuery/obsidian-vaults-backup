# Call Lightning
*3rd-level, Conjuration*  

- **Casting time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 120 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minute

A storm cloud appears in the shape of a cylinder that is 10 feet tall with a 60-foot radius, centered on a point you can see within range directly above you. The spell fails if you can't see a point in the air where the storm cloud could appear (for example, if you are in a room that can't accommodate the cloud).

When you cast the spell, choose a point you can see under the cloud. A bolt of lightning flashes down from the cloud to that point. Each creature within 5 feet of that point must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes `3d10` lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. On each of your turns until the spell ends, you can use your action to call down lightning in this way again, targeting the same point or a different one.

If you are outdoors in stormy conditions when you cast this spell, the spell gives you control over the existing storm instead of creating a new one. Under such conditions, the spell's damage increases by `1d10`.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th or higher level, the damage increases by `1d10` for each slot level above 3rd.

**Classes**: [Bard](list-spells-classes-bard); [Druid](list-spells-classes-druid); [Druid (Circle of the Land)](list-spells-classes-druid-circle-of-the-land); [Cleric (Tempest Domain)](list-spells-classes-cleric-tempest-domain)
