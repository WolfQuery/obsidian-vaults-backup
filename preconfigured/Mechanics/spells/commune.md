# Commune
*5th-level, Divination (ritual)*  

- **Casting time:** 1 minute unless cast as a ritual
- **Range:** Self
- **Components:** V, S, incense and a vial of holy or unholy water
- **Duration:** 1 minute

You contact your deity or a divine proxy and ask up to three questions that can be answered with a yes or no. You must ask your questions before the spell ends. You receive a correct answer for each question.

Divine beings aren't necessarily omniscient, so you might receive "unclear" as an answer if a question pertains to information that lies beyond the deity's knowledge. In a case where a one-word answer could be misleading or contrary to the deity's interests, the DM might offer a short phrase as an answer instead.

If you cast the spell two or more times before finishing your next long rest, there is a cumulative  chance for each casting after the first that you get no answer. The DM makes this roll in secret.

**Classes**: [Bard](list-spells-classes-bard); [Cleric](list-spells-classes-cleric); [Sorcerer (Divine Soul)](list-spells-classes-sorcerer-divine-soul-xge); [Paladin (Oath of Devotion)](list-spells-classes-paladin-oath-of-devotion); [Paladin (Oath of Glory)](list-spells-classes-paladin-oath-of-glory-tce); [Cleric (Order Domain)](list-spells-classes-cleric-order-domain-tce)
