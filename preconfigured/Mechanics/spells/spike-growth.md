# Spike Growth
*2nd-level, Transmutation*  

- **Casting time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 150 feet
- **Components:** V, S, seven sharp thorns or seven small twigs, each sharpened to a point
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minute

The ground in a 20-foot radius centered on a point within range twists and sprouts hard spikes and thorns. The area becomes difficult terrain for the duration. When a creature moves into or within the area, it takes `2d4` piercing damage for every 5 feet it travels.

The transformation of the ground is camouflaged to look natural. Any creature that can't see the area at the time the spell is cast must make a Wisdom ([Perception](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Perception)) check against your spell save DC to recognize the terrain as hazardous before entering it.

**Classes**: [Bard](list-spells-classes-bard); [Druid](list-spells-classes-druid); [Ranger](list-spells-classes-ranger); [Druid (Circle of the Land)](list-spells-classes-druid-circle-of-the-land); [Cleric (Nature Domain)](list-spells-classes-cleric-nature-domain); [Warlock (The Genie)](list-spells-classes-warlock-the-genie-tce)
