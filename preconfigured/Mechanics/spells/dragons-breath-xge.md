# Dragon's Breath
*2nd-level, Transmutation*  

- **Casting time:** 1 bonus
- **Range:** Touch
- **Components:** V, S, a hot pepper
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

You touch one willing creature and imbue it with the power to spew magical energy from its mouth, provided it has one. Choose acid, cold, fire, lightning, or poison. Until the spell ends, the creature can use an action to exhale energy of the chosen type in a 15-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a Dexterity saving throw, taking `3d6` damage of the chosen type on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the damage increases by `1d6` for each slot level above 2nd.

**Classes**: [Bard](list-spells-classes-bard); [Sorcerer](list-spells-classes-sorcerer); [Wizard](list-spells-classes-wizard); [Rogue (Arcane Trickster)](list-spells-classes-rogue-arcane-trickster); [Fighter (Eldritch Knight)](list-spells-classes-fighter-eldritch-knight)
