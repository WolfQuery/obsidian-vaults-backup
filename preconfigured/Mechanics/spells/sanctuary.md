# Sanctuary
*1st-level, Abjuration*  

- **Casting time:** 1 bonus
- **Range:** 30 feet
- **Components:** V, S, a small silver mirror
- **Duration:** 1 minute

You ward a creature within range against attack. Until the spell ends, any creature who targets the warded creature with an attack or a harmful spell must first make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the creature must choose a new target or lose the attack or spell. This spell doesn't protect the warded creature from area effects, such as the explosion of a [fireball](3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/fireball.md).

If the warded creature makes an attack, casts a spell that affects an enemy, or deals damage to another creature, this spell ends.

**Classes**: [Artificer](list-spells-classes-artificer); [Bard](list-spells-classes-bard); [Cleric](list-spells-classes-cleric); [Sorcerer (Divine Soul)](list-spells-classes-sorcerer-divine-soul-xge); [Paladin (Oath of Devotion)](list-spells-classes-paladin-oath-of-devotion); [Paladin (Oath of Redemption)](list-spells-classes-paladin-oath-of-redemption-xge); [Cleric (Peace Domain)](list-spells-classes-cleric-peace-domain-tce); [Warlock (The Genie)](list-spells-classes-warlock-the-genie-tce); [Monk (Way of the Open Hand)](list-spells-classes-monk-way-of-the-open-hand)
