# Calm Emotions
*2nd-level, Enchantment*  

- **Casting time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

You attempt to suppress strong emotions in a group of people. Each humanoid in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on a point you choose within range must make a Charisma saving throw; a creature can choose to fail this saving throw if it wishes. If a creature fails its saving throw, choose one of the following two effects.

You can suppress any effect causing a target to be [charmed](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Charmed) or [frightened](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Frightened). When this spell ends, any suppressed effect resumes, provided that its duration has not expired in the meantime.

Alternatively, you can make a target indifferent about creatures of your choice that it is hostile toward. This indifference ends if the target is attacked or harmed by a spell or if it witnesses any of its friends being harmed. When the spell ends, the creature becomes hostile again, unless the DM rules otherwise.

**Classes**: [Bard](list-spells-classes-bard); [Cleric](list-spells-classes-cleric); [Sorcerer (Aberrant Mind)](list-spells-classes-sorcerer-aberrant-mind-tce); [Sorcerer (Divine Soul)](list-spells-classes-sorcerer-divine-soul-xge); [Paladin (Oath of Redemption)](list-spells-classes-paladin-oath-of-redemption-xge); [Warlock (The Archfey)](list-spells-classes-warlock-the-archfey)
