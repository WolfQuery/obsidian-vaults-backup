# Lightning Bolt
*3rd-level, Evocation*  

- **Casting time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Self (100-feet line)
- **Components:** V, S, a bit of fur and a rod of amber, crystal, or glass

A stroke of lightning forming a line 100 feet long and 5 feet wide blasts out from you in a direction you choose. Each creature in the line must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes `8d6` lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
