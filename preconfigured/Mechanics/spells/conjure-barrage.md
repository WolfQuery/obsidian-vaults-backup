# Conjure Barrage
*3rd-level, Conjuration*  

- **Casting time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Self (60-feet cone)
- **Components:** V, S, one piece of ammunition or a thrown weapon
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

You throw a nonmagical weapon or fire a piece of nonmagical ammunition into the air to create a cone of identical weapons that shoot forward and then disappear. Each creature in a 60-foot cone must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes `3d8` damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. The damage type is the same as that of the weapon or ammunition used as a component.

**Classes**: [Bard](list-spells-classes-bard); [Ranger](list-spells-classes-ranger); [Artificer (Battle Smith)](list-spells-classes-artificer-battle-smith-tce)
