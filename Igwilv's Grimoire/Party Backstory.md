# 🗂️ Party Backstory  
**The Job. The Debt. The Offer.**  
> _"You only work together when you're desperate... or when you've already failed."_

## 🧩 The Big Picture (What You Know)

A few years back, each of you took part—directly or indirectly—in a **high-stakes job**.

The details were kept quiet, and not everyone in the crew even knew each other at the time. But the operation had big promises:  
- Pay off your debts.  
- Get out clean.  
- Secure your future.  

**It didn’t go as planned.**

You scattered, cut ties, or went to ground.  
Someone powerful lost something important.  
And now, someone wants it back.

## 🕵️ The Job (What You Did)

Here’s what remains from that job. Most copies were destroyed. One of you kept this tucked away—burnt at the edges, with blood on the corner.

> ### 📄 CONTRACT – OPERATION “SPLINTER COIN” (EXCERPT)
> *By order of Benefactor No. 9, as negotiated through Contact K.*
>
> - Objective: Extract, secure, and deliver [REDACTED] from Vault 3E.  
> - Reward: Full clearance of debts. Secondary payouts TBD.
> - Deliverables expected within 72 hours.
>
> - You operate as a **deniable asset**. No affiliation with client. No legal protection.  
> - If caught, the syndicate disavows all connection.  
> - Failure voids all terms.  
>
> Signed by:
> - [Name expunged]  
> - [Name expunged]  
> - “K” (witness)  
> - [Bloodstain]

Nobody's quite sure what “Vault 3E” was holding. You weren’t told everything. That’s how these things go.

## 💰 The Debt (Why You Care)

The job failed—or at least, **didn’t succeed the way it was supposed to**.

You're still **deep in debt** to a criminal overlord (or their syndicate). Rumors vary:
- Some say it’s a **mafia-like fixer** called The Collector.
- Others believe it's **a devil in disguise**, working through proxies.
- A few of you might know more... but haven’t said anything yet.

The price on your heads isn’t just monetary—it’s **leverage**. You're useful to someone, and that’s the only reason you're not already dead.

## 🧠 The Connection (Why You’re Here Now)

Recently, a mysterious tiefling named **Verity Kye** reached out.

She claims to have an **opportunity**—a chance to start fresh, make good on your failures, and maybe even break free.

She says she has **a contact on the inside**.
She won’t say who.
But one of you knows exactly who she means.
