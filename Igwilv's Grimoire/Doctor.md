# Traits

##### [[reborn-vrgr#Deathless Nature|Deathless Nature]]
You have escaped death, a fact represented by the following benefits:

- You have advantage on saving throws against disease and being [poisoned](app://obsidian.md/2.%20Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#poisoned), and you have resistance to poison damage.
- You have advantage on death saving throws.
- You don't need to eat, drink, or breathe.
- You don't need to sleep, and magic can't put you to sleep. You can finish a long rest in 4 hours if you spend those hours in an inactive, motionless state, during which you retain consciousness.

---
##### [[reborn-vrgr#Knowledge from a Past Life|Knowledge from a Past Life]]
You temporarily remember glimpses of the past, perhaps faded memories from ages ago or a previous life. When you make an ability check that uses a skill, you can roll a `dice: d6|avg|noform` (`d6`) immediately after seeing the number on the `dice: d20|avg|noform` (`d20`) and add the number on the `dice: d6|avg|noform` (`d6`) to the check. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

#### Cleric Spell List
```custom-frames
frame: Cleric Spell List
```
# Abilities
## [[cleric|Cleric]]; [[cleric-death-domain|Death Domain]]
##### Level 1
###### [[cleric-death-domain#Reaper (Level 1)|Reaper]]
At 1st level, the cleric learns one necromancy cantrip of his or her choice from any spell list. When the cleric casts **a necromancy cantrip that normally targets only one creature, the spell can instead target two creatures within range and within 5 feet of each other.**

---
##### Level 2
###### [[cleric#Channel Divinity (Level 2)|Channel Divinity]]
At 2nd level, you gain the ability to channel divine energy directly from your deity, using that energy to fuel magical effects. You start with two such effects: Turn Undead and an effect determined by your domain. Some domains grant you additional effects as you advance in levels, as noted in the domain description.

When you use your Channel Divinity, you choose which effect to create. You must then finish a short or long rest to use your Channel Divinity again.

Some Channel Divinity effects require saving throws. When you use such an effect from this class, the DC equals your cleric spell save DC.

Beginning at 6th level, you can use your Channel Divinity twice between rests, and beginning at 18th level, you can use it three times between rests. When you finish a short or long rest, you regain your expended uses.

---
###### [[cleric#Channel Divinity Turn Undead (Level 2)|Channel Divinity: Turn Undead]]
As an action, you present your holy symbol and speak a prayer censuring the undead. Each undead that can see or hear you within 30 feet of you must make a Wisdom saving throw. If the creature fails its saving throw, it is turned for 1 minute or until it takes any damage.

A turned creature must spend its turns trying to move as far away from you as it can, and it can't willingly move to a space within 30 feet of you. It also can't take reactions. For its action, it can use only the [Dash](app://obsidian.md/z_compendium/rules/actions.md#Dash) action or try to escape from an effect that prevents it from moving. If there's nowhere to move, the creature can use the [Dodge](app://obsidian.md/z_compendium/rules/actions.md#Dodge) action.

---
###### [[cleric#Channel Divinity Harness Divine Power (Level 2)|Channel Divinity: Harness Divine Power]]
You can expend a use of your Channel Divinity to fuel your spells. As a bonus action, you touch your holy symbol, utter a prayer, and regain one expended spell slot, the level of which can be no higher than half your proficiency bonus (rounded up). The number of times you can use this feature is based on the level you've reached in this class: 2nd level, once; 6th level, twice; and 18th level, thrice. You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

---
###### [[cleric-death-domain#Channel Divinity Touch of Death (Level 2)|Channel Divinity: Touch of Death]]
Starting at 2nd level, the cleric can use Channel Divinity to destroy another creature's life force by touch.

When the cleric hits a creature with a melee attack, the cleric can use Channel Divinity to deal extra necrotic damage to the target. The damage equals 5 + twice his or her cleric level.

---
## [[monk|Monk]]; Way of Mercy
##### Level 1
###### [[monk#Unarmored Defense (Level 1)|Unarmored Defense]]
Beginning at 1st level, while you are wearing no armor and not wielding a shield, **your AC equals 10 + your Dexterity modifier + your Wisdom modifier.**

---
###### [[monk#Martial Arts (Level 1)|Martial Arts]]
Your practice of martial arts gives you mastery of combat styles that use unarmed strikes and monk weapons, which are [shortswords](app://obsidian.md/compendium/items/shortsword.md) and any simple melee weapons that don't have the two-handed or heavy property.

You gain the following benefits while you are unarmed or wielding only monk weapons and you aren't wearing armor or wielding a [shield](app://obsidian.md/compendium/items/shield.md).

- You can use Dexterity instead of Strength for the attack and damage rolls of your unarmed strikes and monk weapons.
- You can roll a `d4` in place of the normal damage of your unarmed strike or monk weapon. This die changes as you gain monk levels, as shown in the Martial Arts column of the Monk table.
- When you use the [Attack](app://obsidian.md/rules/actions.md#Attack) action with an unarmed strike or a monk weapon on your turn, you can make one unarmed strike as a bonus action. For example, if you take the [Attack](app://obsidian.md/rules/actions.md#Attack) action and attack with a quarterstaff, you can also make an unarmed strike as a bonus action, assuming you haven't already taken a bonus action this turn.

Certain monasteries use specialized forms of the monk weapons. For example, you might use a club that is two lengths of wood connected by a short chain (called a nunchaku) or a sickle with a shorter, straighter blade (called a kama).

# Backstory
---
The doctor was once a respected physician and scholar in their homeland, dedicated to the study of life and death. They believed that the soul could be purified through the body, and that death was simply an imbalance, a disease that could be cured. This obsession led them down a dark path, experimenting with forbidden practices in search of the elusive cure for mortality. When they finally achieved what they thought was success, their body decayed but did not die, leaving them in a state of rebirth—neither fully alive nor truly dead.

# Roleplaying Notes
## Spells
### Toll the Dead
**Visual Description:** When you cast _Toll the Dead_, an ancient, ghostly bell rings out, its tone low and resonant. The air around the target grows cold, and spectral hands seem to rise from the ground beneath them, as though death is pulling at their soul. The sound echoes like a distant funeral knell, tugging at the target's very life force.

---
### Thaumaturgy
**Visual Description:** As you cast _Thaumaturgy_, your voice deepens with an eerie echo, reminiscent of something not quite alive. The ground trembles faintly, and nearby lights flicker or dim, as though responding to an unseen, otherworldly presence. Shadows lengthen unnaturally around you, hinting at the thin veil between life and death.

---
### Hand of Radiance
**Visual Description:** Your _Hand of Radiance_ manifests as glowing skeletal hands that erupt from your body, each wreathed in pale, ghostly fire. As they reach out, they burn not with warmth, but with the cold radiance of the grave, each strike pulling vitality from the target as though it’s being judged by death itself.

---
### Inflict Wounds
**Visual Description:** When you touch the target for _Inflict Wounds_, the skin blackens and cracks beneath your hand, the flesh appearing to rot away in real-time. Faint whispers of the dead seem to swirl around you as the life force is violently drained from the target, leaving behind necrotic scars as though they’ve been touched by death’s own hand.

---
### Detect Poison and Disease
**Visual Description:** As you cast _Detect Poison and Disease_, your eyes briefly glow with a sickly green hue, allowing you to perceive the festering rot and corruption in the air. A thin mist appears to rise from anything poisoned or diseased, like a toxic vapor visible only to you, highlighting the sickly aura of decay emanating from the afflicted.

---
### Cure Wounds
**Visual Description:** The process of _Cure Wounds_ begins with a brief, necrotic glow around the wound, the skin blackening as if decomposing. But in the next moment, the dead flesh is sloughed off, revealing newly regenerated tissue beneath. The healing feels unnatural, as if the body is being forcibly reconstructed rather than naturally mended.

---
### Command
**Visual Description:** When you cast _Command_, your voice carries an unnatural authority, as though it echoes from beyond the grave. The air around the target grows heavy, and their will falters momentarily, as if they are hearing the decree of death itself. A faint shadow flickers behind you, hinting at the power you’ve tapped into to enforce your will.
