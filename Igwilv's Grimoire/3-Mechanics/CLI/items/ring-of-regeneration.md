# Ring of Regeneration
*Ring, major, very rare (requires attunement)*  
![](3-Mechanics/CLI/items/img/ring-of-regeneration.webp#right)


While wearing this ring, you regain `dice:1d6|noform|noparens|avg` (`1d6`) hit points every 10 minutes, provided that you have at least 1 hit point. If you lose a body part, the ring causes the missing part to regrow and return to full functionality after `dice:1d6+1|noform|noparens|avg` (`1d6 + 1`) days if you have at least 1 hit point the whole time.
