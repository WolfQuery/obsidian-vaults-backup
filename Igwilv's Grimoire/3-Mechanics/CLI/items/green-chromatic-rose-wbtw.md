# Green Chromatic Rose
*Wondrous item, rare*  



While this rose is held, it issues green gas as a harmless visual effect.

While holding the rose by its stem, you gain resistance to poison damage. If you would take more than 10 poison damage from a single source (after applying the resistance), the rose disintegrates, and you take no damage instead.

As an action, you can blow the petals from the rose to produce a 20-foot cone of poison. Each creature in the cone must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw, taking `dice:3d10|noform|noparens|avg` (`3d10`) poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Using this property destroys the rose.
