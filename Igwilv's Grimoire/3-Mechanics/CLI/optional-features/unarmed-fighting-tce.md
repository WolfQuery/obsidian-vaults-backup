# Unarmed Fighting
*Source: Tasha's Cauldron of Everything p. 42*  
Your unarmed strikes can deal bludgeoning damage equal to `dice:1d6|noform|noparens|avg` (`1d6`) + your Strength modifier on a hit. If you aren't wielding any weapons or a [shield](3-Mechanics/CLI/items/shield.md) when you make the attack roll, the `dice:d6|noform|noparens|avg` (`d6`) becomes a `dice:d8|noform|noparens|avg` (`d8`).

At the start of each of your turns, you can deal `dice:1d4|noform|noparens|avg` (`1d4`) bludgeoning damage to one creature [grappled](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Grappled) by you.
