# Blind Fighting
*Source: Tasha's Cauldron of Everything p. 41*  
You have [blindsight](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/senses.md#Blindsight) with a range of 10 feet. Within that range, you can effectively see anything that isn't behind total cover, even if you're [blinded](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Blinded) or in darkness. Moreover, you can see an [invisible](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Invisible) creature within that range, unless the creature successfully hides from you.
