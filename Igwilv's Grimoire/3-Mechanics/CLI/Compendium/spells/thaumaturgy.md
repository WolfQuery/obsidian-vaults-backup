# Thaumaturgy
*cantrip, Transmutation*  


- **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** 30 feet
- **Components:** V
- **Duration:** 1 minute

You manifest a minor wonder, a sign of supernatural power, within range. You create one of the following magical effects within range:

- Your voice booms up to three times as loud as normal for 1 minute.  
- You cause flames to flicker, brighten, dim, or change color for 1 minute.  
- You cause harmless tremors in the ground for 1 minute.  
- You create an instantaneous sound that originates from a point of your choice within range, such as a rumble of thunder, the cry of a raven, or ominous whispers.  
- You instantaneously cause an unlocked door or window to fly open or slam shut.  
- You alter the appearance of your eyes for 1 minute.  

If you cast this spell multiple times, you can have up to three of its 1-minute effects active at a time, and you can dismiss such an effect as an action.
