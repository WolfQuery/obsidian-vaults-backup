# Sequester
*7th-level, Transmutation*  


- **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** Touch
- **Components:** V, S, M (a powder composed of diamond, emerald, ruby, and sapphire dust worth at least 5,000 gp, which the spell consumes)
- **Duration:** Until dispelled

By means of this spell, a willing creature or an object can be hidden away, safe from detection for the duration. When you cast the spell and touch the target, it becomes [invisible](/3-Mechanics/CLI/Rules/conditions.md#Invisible) and can't be targeted by divination spells or perceived through scrying sensors created by divination spells.

If the target is a creature, it falls into a state of suspended animation. Time ceases to flow for it, and it doesn't grow older.

You can set a condition for the spell to end early. The condition can be anything you choose, but it must occur or be visible within 1 mile of the target. Examples include "after 1,000 years" or "when the [tarrasque](/3-Mechanics/CLI/Compendium/bestiary/monstrosity/tarrasque.md) awakens." This spell also ends if the target takes any damage.

**Classes**: [Bard](/3-Mechanics/CLI/Compendium/lists/list-spells-classes-bard.md); [Wizard](/3-Mechanics/CLI/Compendium/lists/list-spells-classes-wizard.md)
