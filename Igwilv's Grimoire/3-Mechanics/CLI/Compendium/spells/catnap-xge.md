# Catnap
*3rd-level, Enchantment*  


- **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** 30 feet
- **Components:** S, M (a pinch of sand)
- **Duration:** 10 minutes

You make a calming gesture, and up to three willing creatures of your choice that you can see within range fall [unconscious](/3-Mechanics/CLI/Rules/conditions.md#Unconscious) for the spell's duration. The spell ends on a target early if it takes damage or someone uses an action to shake or slap it awake. If a target remains [unconscious](/3-Mechanics/CLI/Rules/conditions.md#Unconscious) for the full duration, that target gains the benefit of a short rest, and it can't be affected by this spell again until it finishes a long rest.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, you can target one additional willing creature for each slot level above 3rd.

**Classes**: [Bard](/3-Mechanics/CLI/Compendium/lists/list-spells-classes-bard.md); [Sorcerer](/3-Mechanics/CLI/Compendium/lists/list-spells-classes-sorcerer.md); [Rogue (Arcane Trickster)](/3-Mechanics/CLI/Compendium/lists/list-spells-classes-arcane-trickster.md); [Wizard](/3-Mechanics/CLI/Compendium/lists/list-spells-classes-wizard.md); [Artificer](/3-Mechanics/CLI/Compendium/lists/list-spells-classes-artificer.md); [Fighter (Eldritch Knight)](/3-Mechanics/CLI/Compendium/lists/list-spells-classes-eldritch-knight.md)
