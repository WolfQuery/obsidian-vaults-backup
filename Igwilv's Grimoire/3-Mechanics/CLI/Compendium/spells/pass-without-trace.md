# Pass without Trace
*2nd-level, Abjuration*  


- **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** Self
- **Components:** V, S, M (ashes from a burned leaf of mistletoe and a sprig of spruce)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 hour

A veil of shadows and silence radiates from you, masking you and your companions from detection. For the duration, each creature you choose within 30 feet of you (including you) has a +10 bonus to Dexterity ([Stealth](/3-Mechanics/CLI/Rules/skills.md#Stealth)) checks and can't be tracked except by magical means. A creature that receives this bonus leaves behind no tracks or other traces of its passage.

**Classes**: [Bard](/3-Mechanics/CLI/Compendium/lists/list-spells-classes-bard.md); [Druid (Circle of the Land)](/3-Mechanics/CLI/Compendium/lists/list-spells-classes-circle-of-the-land.md); [Ranger](/3-Mechanics/CLI/Compendium/lists/list-spells-classes-ranger.md); [Cleric (Trickery Domain)](/3-Mechanics/CLI/Compendium/lists/list-spells-classes-trickery-domain.md); [Monk (Way of Shadow)](/3-Mechanics/CLI/Compendium/lists/list-spells-classes-way-of-shadow.md); [Druid](/3-Mechanics/CLI/Compendium/lists/list-spells-classes-druid.md)
