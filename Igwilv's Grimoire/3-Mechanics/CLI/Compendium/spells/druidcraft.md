Whispering to the spirits of nature, you create one of the following effects within range:

- You instantly make a flower blossom, a seed pod open, or a leaf bud bloom.  
- You create an instantaneous, harmless sensory effect, such as falling leaves, a puff of wind, the sound of a small animal, or the faint odor of skunk. The effect must fit in a 5-foot cube.
