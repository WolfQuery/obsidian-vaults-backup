# Bane
*1st-level, Enchantment*  


- **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** 30 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (a drop of blood)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

Up to three creatures of your choice that you can see within range must make Charisma saving throws. Whenever a target that fails this saving throw makes an attack roll or a saving throw before the spell ends, the target must roll a `dice:d4|noform|noparens|avg` (`d4`) and subtract the number rolled from the attack roll or saving throw.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, you can target one additional creature for each slot level above 1st.
