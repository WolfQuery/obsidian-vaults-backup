# Silence
*2nd-level, Illusion (ritual)*  


- **Casting time:** 1 Action unless cast as a ritual
- **Range:** 120 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes

For the duration, no sound can be created within or pass through a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on a point you choose within range. Any creature or object entirely inside the sphere is immune to thunder damage, and creatures are [deafened](/3-Mechanics/CLI/Rules/conditions.md#Deafened) while entirely inside it. Casting a spell that includes a verbal component is impossible there.

**Classes**: [Bard](/3-Mechanics/CLI/Compendium/lists/list-spells-classes-bard.md); [Sorcerer (Divine Soul)](/3-Mechanics/CLI/Compendium/lists/list-spells-classes-divine-soul-xge.md "subclass=XGE"); [Druid (Circle of the Land)](/3-Mechanics/CLI/Compendium/lists/list-spells-classes-circle-of-the-land.md); [Ranger](/3-Mechanics/CLI/Compendium/lists/list-spells-classes-ranger.md); [Monk (Way of Shadow)](/3-Mechanics/CLI/Compendium/lists/list-spells-classes-way-of-shadow.md); [Cleric](/3-Mechanics/CLI/Compendium/lists/list-spells-classes-cleric.md); [Warlock (The Fathomless)](/3-Mechanics/CLI/Compendium/lists/list-spells-classes-the-fathomless-tce.md "subclass=TCE")
