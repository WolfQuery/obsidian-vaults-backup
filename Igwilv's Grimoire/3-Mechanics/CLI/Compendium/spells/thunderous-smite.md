# Thunderous Smite
*1st-level, Evocation*

- **Range:** Self
- **Components:** V

The first time you hit with a melee weapon attack during this spell's duration, your weapon rings with thunder that is audible within 300 feet of you, and the attack deals an extra `dice:2d6|noform|noparens|avg` (`2d6`) thunder damage to the target. Additionally, if the target is a creature, it must succeed on a Strength saving throw or be pushed 10 feet away from you and knocked [prone](/3-Mechanics/CLI/Rules/conditions.md#Prone).

**Classes**: [Bard](/3-Mechanics/CLI/Compendium/lists/list-spells-classes-bard.md); [Paladin](/3-Mechanics/CLI/Compendium/lists/list-spells-classes-paladin.md)
