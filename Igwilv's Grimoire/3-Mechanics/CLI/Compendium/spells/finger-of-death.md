# Finger of Death
*7th-level, Necromancy*  


- **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

You send negative energy coursing through a creature that you can see within range, causing it searing pain. The target must make a Constitution saving throw. It takes `dice:7d8+30|noform|noparens|avg` (`7d8 + 30`) necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

A humanoid killed by this spell rises at the start of your next turn as a [zombie](/3-Mechanics/CLI/Compendium/bestiary/undead/zombie.md) that is permanently under your command, following your verbal orders to the best of its ability.

**Classes**: [Bard](/3-Mechanics/CLI/Compendium/lists/list-spells-classes-bard.md); [Sorcerer](/3-Mechanics/CLI/Compendium/lists/list-spells-classes-sorcerer.md); [Warlock](/3-Mechanics/CLI/Compendium/lists/list-spells-classes-warlock.md); [Wizard](/3-Mechanics/CLI/Compendium/lists/list-spells-classes-wizard.md)
