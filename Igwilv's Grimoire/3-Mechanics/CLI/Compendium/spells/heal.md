# Heal
*6th-level, Evocation*  


- **Casting time:** 1 Action

Choose a creature that you can see within range. A surge of positive energy washes through the creature, causing it to regain 70 hit points. This spell also ends [blindness](/3-Mechanics/CLI/Rules/conditions.md#Blinded), [deafness](/3-Mechanics/CLI/Rules/conditions.md#Deafened), and any diseases affecting the target. This spell has no effect on constructs or undead.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 7th level or higher, the amount of healing increases by 10 for each slot level above 6th.
