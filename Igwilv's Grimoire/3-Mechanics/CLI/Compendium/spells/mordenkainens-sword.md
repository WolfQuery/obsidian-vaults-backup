# Mordenkainen's Sword
*7th-level, Evocation*  
![](/3-Mechanics/CLI/Compendium/spells/img/mordenkainens-sword.webp#right)

- **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (a miniature platinum sword with a grip and pommel of copper and zinc, worth 250 gp)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

You create a sword-shaped plane of force that hovers within range. It lasts for the duration.

When the sword appears, you make a melee spell attack against a target of your choice within 5 feet of the sword. On a hit, the target takes `dice:3d10|noform|noparens|avg` (`3d10`) force damage. Until the spell ends, you can use a bonus action on each of your turns to move the sword up to 20 feet to a spot you can see and repeat this attack against the same target or a different one.

**Classes**: [Bard](/3-Mechanics/CLI/Compendium/lists/list-spells-classes-bard.md); [Wizard](/3-Mechanics/CLI/Compendium/lists/list-spells-classes-wizard.md)
