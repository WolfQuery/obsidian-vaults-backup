# Fulminating Treatise
*Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement by a wizard)*  
![](/3-Mechanics/CLI/Compendium/items/img/fulminating-treatise.webp#right)

- **Weight**: 3.0 lbs.

This thick, scorched spellbook reeks of smoke and ozone, and sparks of energy crackles along the edges of its pages. When found, the book contains the following spells: [contingency](/3-Mechanics/CLI/Compendium/spells/contingency.md), [fireball](/3-Mechanics/CLI/Compendium/spells/fireball.md), [gust of wind](/3-Mechanics/CLI/Compendium/spells/gust-of-wind.md), [Leomund's tiny hut](/3-Mechanics/CLI/Compendium/spells/leomunds-tiny-hut.md), [magic missile](/3-Mechanics/CLI/Compendium/spells/magic-missile.md), [thunderwave](/3-Mechanics/CLI/Compendium/spells/thunderwave.md), and [wall of force](/3-Mechanics/CLI/Compendium/spells/wall-of-force.md). It functions as a spellbook for you.

While you are holding the book, you can use it as a spellcasting focus for your wizard spells.

The book has 3 charges, and it regains `dice:1d3|noform|noparens|avg` (`d3`) expended charges daily at dawn. You can use the charges in the following ways while holding it:

- If you spend 1 minute studying the book, you can expend 1 charge to replace one of your prepared wizard spells with a different spell in the book. The new spell must be of the evocation school.  
- When one creature you can see takes damage from an evocation spell you cast, you can use your reaction and expend 1 charge to deal an extra `dice:2d6|noform|noparens|avg` (`2d6`) force damage to the creature and knock the creature [prone](/3-Mechanics/CLI/Rules/conditions.md#Prone) if it is Large or smaller.
