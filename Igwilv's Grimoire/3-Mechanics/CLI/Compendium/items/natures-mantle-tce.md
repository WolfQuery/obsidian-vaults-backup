# Nature's Mantle
*Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement by a druid or ranger)*  
![](/3-Mechanics/CLI/Compendium/items/img/natures-mantle.webp#right)

- **Weight**: 2.0 lbs.

This cloak shifts color and texture to blend with the terrain surrounding you. While wearing the cloak, you can use it as a spellcasting focus for your druid and ranger spells.

While you are in an area that is lightly obscured, you can [Hide](/3-Mechanics/CLI/Rules/actions.md#Hide) as a bonus action even if you are being directly observed.
