# Tangler Grenade



A tangler grenade is an alchemical, nonmagical item with an ovoid resin shell that shatters on impact. An as action, a creature can throw a tangler grenade at a point up to 60 feet away. Each creature within 10 feet of a shattered tangler grenade must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or be [restrained](/3-Mechanics/CLI/Rules/conditions.md#Restrained) by sticky white webs. As an action, a creature can try to free itself or another creature within its reach from the webs, doing so with a successful DC 20 Strength ([Athletics](/3-Mechanics/CLI/Rules/skills.md#Athletics)) check. A gallon of alcohol dissolves the webs produced by a single tangler grenade. Otherwise, the webs dissolve on their own after 1 hour, freeing any creatures [restrained](/3-Mechanics/CLI/Rules/conditions.md#Restrained) by them.
