# White Chromatic Rose
*Wondrous item, rare*  



While this rose is held, it is covered in frost as a harmless visual effect.

While holding the rose by its stem, you gain resistance to cold damage. If you would take more than 10 cold damage from a single source (after applying the resistance), the rose disintegrates, and you take no damage instead.

As an action, you can blow the petals from the rose to produce a 20-foot cone of cold. Each creature in the cone must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw, taking `dice:3d10|noform|noparens|avg` (`3d10`) cold damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Using this property destroys the rose.
