# Horn of Blasting
*Wondrous item, major, rare*  
![](/3-Mechanics/CLI/Compendium/items/img/horn-of-blasting.webp#right)

- **Weight**: 2.0 lbs.

You can use an action to speak the horn's command word and then blow the horn, which emits a thunderous blast in a 30-foot cone that is audible 600 feet away. Each creature in the cone must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes `dice:5d6|noform|noparens|avg` (`5d6`) thunder damage and is [deafened](/3-Mechanics/CLI/Rules/conditions.md#Deafened) for 1 minute. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage and isn't [deafened](/3-Mechanics/CLI/Rules/conditions.md#Deafened). Creatures and objects made of glass or crystal have disadvantage on the saving throw and take `dice:10d6|noform|noparens|avg` (`10d6`) thunder damage instead of `dice:5d6|noform|noparens|avg` (`5d6`).

Each use of the horn's magic has a 20 percent chance of causing the horn to explode. The explosion deals `dice:10d6|noform|noparens|avg` (`10d6`) fire damage to the blower and destroys the horn.
