# Burnt Othur Fumes
*Adventuring gear, poison (inhaled)*  


- **Properties**: [Poison](/3-Mechanics/CLI/Rules/item-properties.md#Poison)
- **Cost**: 500 gp

A creature subjected to this poison must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or take `dice:3d6|noform|noparens|avg|text(10)` (`3d6`) poison damage, and must repeat the saving throw at the start of each of its turns. On each successive failed save, the character takes `dice:1d6|noform|noparens|avg|text(3)` (`d6`) poison damage. After three successful saves, the poison ends.
