# Instrument of the Bards, Anstruth Harp
*Wondrous item, instrument, major, very rare (requires attunement by a bard)*  
![](/3-Mechanics/CLI/Compendium/items/img/instrument-of-the-bards-anstruth-harp.webp#right)

- **Weight**: 2.0 lbs.

An instrument of the bards is an exquisite example of its kind, superior to an ordinary instrument in every way. Seven types of these instruments exist, each named after a legendary bard college. A creature that attempts to play the instrument without being attuned to it must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or take `dice:2d4|noform|noparens|avg` (`2d4`) psychic damage.

You can use an action to play the instrument and cast one of its spells. Once the instrument has been used to cast a spell, it can't be used to cast that spell again until the next dawn. The spells use your spellcasting ability and spell save DC.

You can play the instrument while casting a spell that causes any of its targets to be [charmed](/3-Mechanics/CLI/Rules/conditions.md#Charmed) on a failed saving throw, thereby imposing disadvantage on the save. This effect applies only if the spell has a somatic or a material component.

All instruments of the bards can be used to cast the following spells: [fly](/3-Mechanics/CLI/Compendium/spells/fly.md), [invisibility](/3-Mechanics/CLI/Compendium/spells/invisibility.md), [levitate](/3-Mechanics/CLI/Compendium/spells/levitate.md), and [protection from evil and good](/3-Mechanics/CLI/Compendium/spells/protection-from-evil-and-good.md).

In addition, the Anstruth harp can be used to cast [control weather](/3-Mechanics/CLI/Compendium/spells/control-weather.md), [cure wounds](/3-Mechanics/CLI/Compendium/spells/cure-wounds.md) (5th level), and [wall of thorns](/3-Mechanics/CLI/Compendium/spells/wall-of-thorns.md).
