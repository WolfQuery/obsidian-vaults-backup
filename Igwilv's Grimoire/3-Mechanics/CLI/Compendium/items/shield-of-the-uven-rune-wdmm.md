# Shield of the Uven Rune
*Armor ([shield](/3-Mechanics/CLI/Compendium/items/shield.md)), very rare (requires attunement)*  


- **Armor Class**: 2
- **Weight**: 6.0 lbs.

This shield is made from the scale of an ancient white dragon. It has a rune burned into its outward-facing side. A character who examines the rune and succeeds on a DC 20 Intelligence ([History](/3-Mechanics/CLI/Rules/skills.md#History)) check recognizes it as an uven ("enemy" in Giant) rune that confers great power.

While holding the shield, you benefit from the following properties.

## Winter's Friend

You are immune to cold damage.

## Deadly Rebuke

Immediately after a creature hits you with a melee attack, you can use your reaction to deal `dice:3d6|noform|noparens|avg` (`3d6`) necrotic damage to that creature.

## Bane

You can cast the [bane](/3-Mechanics/CLI/Compendium/spells/bane.md) spell from the shield (save DC 17). The spell does not require [concentration](/3-Mechanics/CLI/Rules/conditions.md#Concentration) and lasts for 1 minute. Once you cast the spell from the shield, you can't do so again until you finish a short or long rest.

## Gift of Vengeance

You can transfer the shield's magic to a nonmagical weapon by tracing the uven rune on the weapon with one finger. The transfer takes 8 hours of work that requires the two items to be within 5 feet of each other. At the end, the shield is destroyed, and the rune is etched or burned into the chosen weapon. This weapon becomes a rare magic item that requires attunement. It has the properties of a +1 weapon. The bonus increases to +3 when the weapon is used against one of the following creature types, chosen by you at the time of the magic weapon's creation: aberrations, celestials, constructs, dragons, elementals, fey, fiends, giants, or undead.
