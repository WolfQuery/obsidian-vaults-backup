# Eyes of Minute Seeing
*Wondrous item, minor, uncommon*  



These crystal lenses fit over the eyes. While wearing them, you can see much better than normal out to a range of 1 foot. You have advantage on Intelligence ([Investigation](/3-Mechanics/CLI/Rules/skills.md#Investigation)) checks that rely on sight while searching an area or studying an object within that range.
