# Pipe of Smoke Monsters
*Wondrous item, minor, common*  
![](/3-Mechanics/CLI/Compendium/items/img/pipe-of-smoke-monsters.webp#right)


While smoking this pipe, you can use an action to exhale a puff of smoke that takes the form of a single creature, such as a dragon, a flumph, or a froghemoth. The form must be small enough to fit in a 1-foot cube and loses its shape after a few seconds, becoming an ordinary puff of smoke.
