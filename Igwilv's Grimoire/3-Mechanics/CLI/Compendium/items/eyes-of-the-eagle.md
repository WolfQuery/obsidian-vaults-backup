# Eyes of the Eagle
*Wondrous item, major, uncommon (requires attunement)*  
![](/3-Mechanics/CLI/Compendium/items/img/eyes-of-the-eagle.webp#right)


These crystal lenses fit over the eyes. While wearing them, you have advantage on Wisdom ([Perception](/3-Mechanics/CLI/Rules/skills.md#Perception)) checks that rely on sight. In conditions of clear visibility, you can make out details of even extremely distant creatures and objects as small as 2 feet across.
