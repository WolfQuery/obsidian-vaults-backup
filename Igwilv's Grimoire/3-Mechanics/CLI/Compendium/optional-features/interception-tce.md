When a creature you can see hits a target, other than you, within 5 feet of you with an attack, you can use your reaction to reduce the damage the target takes by `dice:1d10|noform|noparens|avg` (`d10`) + your proficiency bonus (to a minimum of 0 damage). You must be wielding a [shield](/3-Mechanics/CLI/Compendium/items/shield.md) or a simple or martial weapon to use this reaction.
