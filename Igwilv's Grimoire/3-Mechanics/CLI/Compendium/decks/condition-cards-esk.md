# Condition Cards
*Source: Essentials Kit p. 3*  

These cards describe various conditions that can affect creatures in the game. A player whose character is suffering from a condition can keep the card as a reminder, giving it back to you when the condition ends for that character; > [!note]
> either physically with the printed copies, or in a VTT.
