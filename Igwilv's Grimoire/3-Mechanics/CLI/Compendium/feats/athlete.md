You have undergone extensive physical training to gain the following benefits:

- Increase your Strength or Dexterity by 1, to a maximum of 20.  
- When you are [prone](/3-Mechanics/CLI/Rules/conditions.md#Prone), standing up uses only 5 feet of your movement.  
- Climbing doesn't cost you extra movement.  
- You can make a running long jump or a running high jump after moving only 5 feet on foot, rather than 10 feet.
