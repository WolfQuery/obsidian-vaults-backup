A drow house captain leads the troops of an Underdark faction, whether defending a stronghold or leading forces against enemies. These officers make extensive study of strategy and tactics to become effective leaders in battle.

Among Lolth's devotees in the city of Menzoberranzan in the Forgotten Realms, each noble house entrusts the leadership of its military forces to a house captain, who is typically the first or second son of a drow matron mother. Elsewhere drow house captains fight in the war against Lolth, often allying with duergar and others who also wish to rid their subterranean world of that god's malevolence.
