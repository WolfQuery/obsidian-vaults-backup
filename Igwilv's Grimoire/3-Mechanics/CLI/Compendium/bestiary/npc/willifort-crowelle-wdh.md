      \ 60 feet of it. The effect can penetrate barriers, but 3 feet of wood or dirt,\
      \ 2 feet of stone, 2 inches of metal, or a thin sheet of lead blocks it. While\
      \ the target is in range, Willifort can continue reading its thoughts, as long\
      \ as Willifort's [concentration](/3-Mechanics/CLI/Rules/conditions.md#Concentration)\
      \ isn't broken (as if [concentrating](/3-Mechanics/CLI/Rules/conditions.md#Concentration)\
      \ on a spell). While reading the target's mind, Willifort has advantage on Wisdom\

      \ [Intimidation](/3-Mechanics/CLI/Rules/skills.md#Intimidation), and [Persuasion](/3-Mechanics/CLI/Rules/skills.md#Persuasion))\
