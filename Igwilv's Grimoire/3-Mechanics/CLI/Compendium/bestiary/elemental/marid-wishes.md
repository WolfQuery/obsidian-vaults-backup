  - "desc": "The genie power to grant wishes is legendary among mortals. Only the\
      \ most potent genies, such as those among the nobility, can do so. A particular\
      \ genie that has this power can grant one to three wishes to a creature that\
      \ isn't a genie. Once a genie has granted its limit of wishes, it can't grant\
      \ wishes again for some amount of time (usually 1 year), and cosmic law dictates\
      \ that the same genie can expend its limit of wishes on a specific creature\
      \ only once in that creature's existence.\n\nTo be granted a wish, a creature\
      \ within 60 feet of the genie states a desired effect to it. The genie can then\
      \ cast the [wish](/3-Mechanics/CLI/Compendium/spells/wish.md) spell on the creature's\
      \ behalf to bring about the effect. Depending on the genie's nature, the genie\
      \ might try to pervert the intent of the wish by exploiting the wish's poor\
      \ wording. The perversion of the wording is usually crafted to be to the genie's\
      \ benefit."
