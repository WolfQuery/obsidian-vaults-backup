# Necrotic Tempest
*Eldritch Storm*  

Storms infused with the essence of death roil with dark clouds that manifest leering skulls and bone-white lightning. Any creature exposed to the storm that isn't a construct or an undead must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw at the end of each minute or take `dice:3d6|noform|noparens|avg` (`3d6`) necrotic damage.

A creature that dies in a necrotic tempest rises as a [skeleton](/3-Mechanics/CLI/Compendium/bestiary/undead/skeleton.md) or [zombie](/3-Mechanics/CLI/Compendium/bestiary/undead/zombie.md) (your choice) `dice:1d10|noform|noparens|avg` (`d10`) minutes later.

A necrotic tempest lasts for `dice:1d4|noform|noparens|avg` (`d4`) hours and leaves crops withered and wells undrinkable for `dice:1d4|noform|noparens|avg` (`d4`) days after its passing.
