# Sunburst
*8th-level, Evocation*  


- **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** 150 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (fire and a piece of sunstone)
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

Brilliant sunlight flashes in a 60-foot radius centered on a point you choose within range. Each creature in that light must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes `dice:12d6|noform|noparens|avg` (`12d6`) radiant damage and is [blinded](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Blinded) for 1 minute. On a successful save, it takes half as much damage and isn't [blinded](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Blinded) by this spell. Undead and oozes have disadvantage on this saving throw.

A creature [blinded](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Blinded) by this spell makes another Constitution saving throw at the end of each of its turns. On a successful save, it is no longer [blinded](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Blinded).

This spell dispels any darkness in its area that was created by a spell.
