# Melf's Minute Meteors
*3rd-level, Evocation*  


- **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** Self
- **Components:** V, S, M (niter, sulfur, and pine tar formed into a bead)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes

You create six tiny meteors in your space. They float in the air and orbit you for the spell's duration. When you cast the spell—and as a bonus action on each of your turns thereafter—you can expend one or two of the meteors, sending them streaking toward a point or points you choose within 120 feet of you. Once a meteor reaches its destination or impacts against a solid surface, the meteor explodes. Each creature within 5 feet of the point where the meteor explodes must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes `dice:2d6|noform|noparens|avg` (`2d6`) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the number of meteors created increases by two for each slot level above 3rd.
