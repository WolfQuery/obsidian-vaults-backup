# Eldritch Blast
*cantrip, Evocation*  


- **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** 120 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

A beam of crackling energy streaks toward a creature within range. Make a ranged spell attack against the target. On a hit, the target takes `dice:1d10|noform|noparens|avg` (`1d10`) force damage.

The spell creates more than one beam when you reach higher levels: two beams at 5th level, three beams at 11th level, and four beams at 17th level. You can direct the beams at the same target or at different ones. Make a separate attack roll for each beam.

**Classes**: [Bard](3-Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-bard.md); [Warlock](3-Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-warlock.md)
