# Tasha's Caustic Brew
*1st-level, Evocation*  


- **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** Self (30-foot Line)
- **Components:** V, S, M (a bit of rotten food)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

A stream of acid emanates from you in a line 30 feet long and 5 feet wide in a direction you choose. Each creature in the line must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or be covered in acid for the spell's duration or until a creature uses its action to scrape or wash the acid off itself or another creature. A creature covered in the acid takes `dice:2d4|noform|noparens|avg` (`2d4`) acid damage at start of each of its turns.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the damage increases by `dice:2d4|noform|noparens|avg|text(2d4)` for each slot level above 1st.

**Classes**: [Sorcerer](3-Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-sorcerer.md); [Bard](3-Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-bard.md); [Fighter (Eldritch Knight)](3-Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-fighter-eldritch-knight.md); [Rogue (Arcane Trickster)](3-Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-rogue-arcane-trickster.md); [Artificer](3-Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-artificer.md); [Wizard](3-Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-wizard.md)
