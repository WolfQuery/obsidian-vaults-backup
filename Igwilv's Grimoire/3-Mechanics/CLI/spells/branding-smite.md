# Branding Smite
*2nd-level, Evocation*  


- **Casting time:** 1 Bonus Action
- **Range:** Self
- **Components:** V
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

The next time you hit a creature with a weapon attack before this spell ends, the weapon gleams with astral radiance as you strike. The attack deals an extra `dice:2d6|noform|noparens|avg` (`2d6`) radiant damage to the target, which becomes visible if it's [invisible](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Invisible), and the target sheds dim light in a 5-foot radius and can't become [invisible](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Invisible) until the spell ends.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the extra damage increases by `dice:1d6|noform|noparens|avg|text(1d6)` for each slot level above 2nd.

**Classes**: [Bard](3-Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-bard.md); [Paladin](3-Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-paladin.md)
