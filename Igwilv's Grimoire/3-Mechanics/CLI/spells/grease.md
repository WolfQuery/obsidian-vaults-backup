- **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** 60 feet

Slick grease covers the ground in a 10-foot square centered on a point within range and turns it into difficult terrain for the duration.

When the grease appears, each creature standing in its area must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or fall [prone](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Prone). A creature that enters the area or ends its turn there must also succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or fall [prone](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Prone).
