# Vicious Mockery
*cantrip, Enchantment*  


- **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** V
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

You unleash a string of insults laced with subtle enchantments at a creature you can see within range. If the target can hear you (though it need not understand you), it must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or take `dice:1d4|noform|noparens|avg` (`1d4`) psychic damage and have disadvantage on the next attack roll it makes before the end of its next turn.

This spell's damage increases by `dice:1d4|noform|noparens|avg` (`1d4`) when you reach 5th level (`dice:2d4|noform|noparens|avg` (`2d4`)), 11th level (`dice:3d4|noform|noparens|avg` (`3d4`)), and 17th level (`dice:4d4|noform|noparens|avg` (`4d4`)).

**Classes**: [Bard](3-Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-bard.md)
