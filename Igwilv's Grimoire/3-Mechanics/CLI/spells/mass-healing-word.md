# Mass Healing Word
*3rd-level, Evocation*  


- **Casting time:** 1 Bonus Action
- **Range:** 60 feet

As you call out words of restoration, up to six creatures of your choice that you can see within range regain hit points equal to `dice:1d4|noform|noparens|avg` (`1d4`) + your spellcasting ability modifier. This spell has no effect on undead or constructs.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the healing increases by `dice:1d4|noform|noparens|avg|text(1d4)` for each slot level above 3rd.
