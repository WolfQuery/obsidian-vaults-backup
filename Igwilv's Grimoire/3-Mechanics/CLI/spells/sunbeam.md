# Sunbeam
*6th-level, Evocation*  


- **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** Self (60-foot Line)
- **Components:** V, S, M (a magnifying glass)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

A beam of brilliant light flashes out from your hand in a 5-foot-wide, 60-foot-long line. Each creature in the line must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes `dice:6d8|noform|noparens|avg` (`6d8`) radiant damage and is [blinded](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Blinded) until your next turn. On a successful save, it takes half as much damage and isn't [blinded](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Blinded) by this spell. Undead and oozes have disadvantage on this saving throw.

You can create a new line of radiance as your action on any turn until the spell ends.

For the duration, a mote of brilliant radiance shines in your hand. It sheds bright light in a 30-foot radius and dim light for an additional 30 feet. This light is sunlight.
