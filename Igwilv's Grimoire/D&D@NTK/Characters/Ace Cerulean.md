# **Description**
Ace Cerulean Counterbeth is a **towering, powerful Abyssal Minotaur** with a sassy and aggressive personality. Standing at **6'3"**, she has **tan skin, black fur, and striking purple eyes**. She sports a **nose ring, an eyebrow piercing, and arm tattoos**, adding to her intimidating and rebellious aura. Ace's loud voice and drastic way of speaking make her presence impossible to ignore. She dresses in a **short fur coat draped over her shoulders**, a **simple top**, and a **robe**, striking a balance between rugged practicality and effortless dominance.

# **Backstory / Lore**

Ace grew up as an **orphan**, learning early on that **strength and ferocity** were the only things that kept people from walking all over her. With no family to rely on, she **carved her own path**, embracing the wild chaos within her Abyssal bloodline. Her raw power and wild magic abilities led her down the path of a **barbarian**, where she honed her skills through **boxing and brawling**.

She now works as a **bartender**, a job she took mostly for the **free alcohol** and the excuse to **throw unruly customers out the door**. Her life has been filled with **constant harassment**, leading to her **deep discomfort with sex and nudity**, which she fiercely rejects. Her only true friend—and rival—is **Lilith**, her boxing partner, who shares her love for combat and keeps her skills sharp.
