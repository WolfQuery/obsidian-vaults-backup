![[Bob Lunarwell.jpg|500]]

## **Description**
A wise yet overthinking Owlin astrologist with a calming presence and a soft, gentle voice. Known for his cooing speech and tall, slim figure adorned with light purple feathers and a moon sigil pendant.

## **Backstory / Lore**
Bob was born into a family of astrologists but stands out as the only one gifted with magical abilities. Abandoned by his father during childhood, he grew up with a strong bond with his loving mother, who continues to care for him even at the age of 30. His passion for astronomy and magic was rewarded by the moon itself, which bestowed upon him a sacred sigil pendant. Despite his wisdom and kind heart, Bob harbors deep-seated insecurities from his father’s absence and lives as a closeted gay man. His rivalry with Elizabeth, a peer from his academy days, continues to push him to grow.

> [!NOTE]
> Trauma includes his parents' divorce, leaving him with "daddy issues" and a fear of women.

# **Goals**
- **Short-Term Goals:** Master his Lunar Sorcerer magic and uncover new celestial knowledge.  
- **Long-Term Goals:** Reconnect with his estranged father and gain recognition as a renowned astrologist.

# **DM Notes**
> [!Note]- Plot Hooks 
> The moon sigil pendant was a gift from an ancient celestial being who might return for his help.  
> Bob’s rival, Elizabeth, has a hidden grudge and could become a recurring antagonist.  

 >[!TIP]
> Bob’s physical weaknesses and submissive nature can create roleplaying opportunities, especially in challenging or comedic scenarios.
