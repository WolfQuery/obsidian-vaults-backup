>"The Afterlife Casino is a new Nine Hellsâ€“themed attraction just outside town. The owner, Quentin Togglepocket, built it using prize money he stole from me, and I'd like you to give him hell. He's **hosting a tournament** there. I want you to **steal the erinyes statuette** he plans to award as a prize, embarrassing him in front of the big names at the tournament. I also want you to **steal back the five thousand gold pieces** he stole from me. **Bring the statuette and the gold here,** where I'll be waiting for you."
